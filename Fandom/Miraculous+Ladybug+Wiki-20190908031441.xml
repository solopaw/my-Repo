== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Alya is a Martiniquan Creole-French girl with the height of 5'5&quot;. She has hazel eyes and heart-shaped lips. Alya has wavy and reddish-brown ombre hair which grows slightly past her shoulders, with the tips of her hair having a lighter shade of copper-red. Above her right eyebrow, she has a beauty mark.

=== Civilian attire ===
She wears black-rimmed glasses, with a white spot on each side, while her outfit consists of a white tank top underneath a short-sleeved plaid shirt with white, orange, and purple stripes; light blue jeans, and white sneakers with black tops. She wears a light berry-colored lipstick.

=== As Rena Rouge ===
[[File:Rena Rouge Casual Continued.gif|thumb|left|200px]]
When transformed, Rena Rouge's hair becomes a three-tone ombré, having the roots turn dark red/red-orange, blending to orange with the tips being white, and she wears her hair back into a high ponytail with an orange hairband. She wears an orange mask with a white bottom half and a black mark above each eye. Two orange fox ears with white insides, black tips, and black edges are attached to the top of her head. The top layer of her suit, akin to an overcoat, is orange with a white front, a black swan-necked collar, and black arms and gloves up to the middle of her upper arms. The overcoat layer attaches down the vertical front center with a zipper, and the Fox Miraculous becomes the zipper. The overcoat also has a long fox tail-like coattail that ends a bit below her knees at a sharp white tip. The bottom layer of her suit is orange with a white center on the front of the body and black legs starting at a point in the middle of her upper legs. She also wears black boots with orange soles and black fox paw print markings. She attaches her [[Flute|flute]] diagonally on her back when it's not being used.

=== As Lady Wifi ===
Lady Wifi has a black butterfly-shaped mask on her face, and her eyes are dark magenta. She wears a black suit, her lower arms, and legs white with three stripes that are white above each. On her chest is a glowing hot pink Wi-Fi symbol, and a thin white line goes around her waist, with the line creating a semicircle above a short vertical white line in the front, resembling a power button.

=== As Rena Rage ===
In &quot;Mayura&quot; Rena Rage has the same appearance as her superhero counterpart except for being red all over, owing to her having been taken over by a scarlet akuma. Her appearance resulting from a regular akuma is unknown.

=== As Oblivio ===
Oblivio is a purple silhouette that has a laser cannon in its left hand and wears a gray glove on its right hand.

{{For2|more of Alya's outfits and designs|Alya Césaire/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:OR1-(300).png|thumb|left|Alya and Marinette sharing macarons after befriending each other.]]
Alya is rather energetic, passionate, and funny, confident, yet down to earth and smart. She is extremely loyal, supportive, helpful, and sometimes pushy, such as when she goes out of her way to encourage and (sometimes literally) push [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] into spending time with [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]]. She is also very stubborn when it comes to doing things her way, such as the photo shoot in [[Reflekdoll]]. Her cleverness and foresight have come in handy many times. After Marinette thinks she accidentally lost a video of Ladybug on Alya's [[Alya's cellphone|cellphone]], Alya explains that she had already posted the video on her blog, mindful that something might go wrong when she showed Marinette the video. From thoroughly observing Ladybug and Cat Noir in action, Alya has figured out the basics of the superheroes' work, such as breaking the [[List of akumatized objects|akumatized object]] to stop the [[Akumatized villains|villain]]. She doesn't like being undermined or doubted by others, especially when it comes to her work.

[[File:SW_(927).png|thumb|Alya entertains Manon with a story.]]
Alya has a dramatic side to her personality as well, such as when she pretends to be a unicorn with Manon (in &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;) and when she later makes an excuse to [[Vincent|Adrien's photographer]], who asks her to be a support model for Adrien, so Marinette can do the modeling instead. Having to babysit her younger siblings at home, she is great with kids. When it comes to anything involving Ladybug and Cat Noir, Alya easily becomes very excited and basically has a single goal of updating her blog as soon as possible, such as when in &quot;[[The Pharaoh]]&quot;, she is kidnapped by [[Jalil Kubdel|the titular villain]] to be a sacrifice yet still records herself and live streams the video on her blog. She also tends to jump to conclusions, such as when she quickly suspects [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]] of being Ladybug after seeing the girl with her own Ladybug suit and toy yo-yo and mistaking them for the real ones. She also has a habit of never checking her sources or doing ethical investigating of her blog posts, while demanding others to provide proof for their claims, even though she doesn't to that herself often. In &quot;[[Volpina]]&quot;, she readily believes [[Lila Rossi|Lila]]'s claim of once being saved by Ladybug. Alya was for a long time intent on finding out what the civilian identities of the two superheroes are and was willing to follow almost any lead she was given towards that goal. In her pursuit of the truth, Alya tends to forget her own safety at times, needing rescue by the very superheroes she's filming. Sometimes, she goes too far, such as spying on Chloé's locker, which results in her getting punished by [[Mr. Damocles]].

[[File:OR1-(1044).png|thumb|left|Alya disregards her safety to film Ladybug.]]
As described by Cat Noir in &quot;The Pharaoh&quot;, Alya is a &quot;brave chick,&quot; unafraid to get close to villains or willing to jump into danger to protect others. Her bravery and determination has helped both civilians and superheroes, such as when she makes a plan with her classmates to save Marinette in &quot;[[Befana]]&quot;, sacrificing herself in the process, and when she rides a bike to distract the [[August|titular villain]] of &quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot; from harming Ladybug, showing her skills as a leader. As Ladybug, Marinette in &quot;The Pharaoh&quot; also calls Alya bossy, feisty, and bold.

[[File:Sapotis-000589.png|thumb|Alya is delighted when Ladybug presents her with the Fox Miraculous.]]
She holds great admiration and respect for the two superheroes, especially Ladybug, wishing to know anything and everything about her. Much more, she wildly dreams of knowing Ladybug's identity but would respect her desire to keep it secret, and wishes to work alongside her, as mentioned in the [[Ladyblog]] and &quot;[[Sapotis]]&quot;. Also in the same episode, most of that dream come true when the superheroine chooses her to wield the Fox Miraculous and asks Alya for her help in defeating the villain. She greatly values the trust Ladybug has in her, making Alya someone of her word, and she has a burning desire to continue helping her new teammates. Another side to her is that she can be a bit demanding at times just as keeping Nino in line about revealing Marinette's crush on Adrien. 

[[File:Sapotis-000891.png|thumb|left|Rena Rouge assists Ladybug and Cat Noir.]]
As Rena Rouge, Alya retains most of her personality traits such as her undying loyalty, trustworthiness, and curiosity about Ladybug and Cat Noir. She is supportive of her allies, whom she gets very excited about working with, causing her to be a bit of a scatterbrain. A fast learner, Rena Rouge takes quickly to her new abilities, but while it is hard for her to give her Miraculous back to Ladybug, she keeps to her promise.

As Lady Wifi, her desire for answers increases considerably. Despising Ladybug's secrecy, she will stop at nothing to find out her secret identity, even if it means exposing a horrible person underneath, such as when she believes that Chloé is Ladybug. Her speediness to update onlookers remains the same, but her methods for finding info become sneakier and harsher.

As Oblivio, she wants nothing more than to erase the memories of everyone in Paris.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
[[File:PH S01EP06 (236).png|thumb|Alya filming Ladybug for her blog.]]
Alya is very tech-savvy. She keeps up the school blog and Ladyblog with ease, uploading videos, streaming live recordings, and adding articles. She records with her cellphone and knows how to download videos from it. Along with technological skills, Alya is a very good writer, composing blogs for Ladybug and penning the script for Nino's film in &quot;Horrificator&quot;. She excels at presenting herself in her videos, explaining situations when needed and usually keeping her cool if the situation gets dangerous, as with the Pharaoh. Observant and a quick thinker, Alya has figured out a lot of things about Ladybug, Cat Noir, their Miraculouses, and the villains they fight from watching them.

=== As Rena Rouge ===
[[File:Mirage_Sequence_(06).png|thumb|left|Rena Rouge plays her flute.]]
Rena Rouge has enhanced skills, such as speed, strength, and most prominently, agility, shown when she can jump to heights that Ladybug and Cat Noir cannot. Rena Rouge uses her [[flute]] as her [[Miraculous tools|weapon]], being able to fight with it easily, and also uses it for her special power.
Like a fox, she also enhanced senses such as hearing, smell and night vision.

Her special power, [[Mirage]], is executed by playing her flute to produce an orange ball of energy at the far end of it. Wherever she throws the ball of energy by swinging the flute, it creates an illusion. However, the illusion disappears if it is touched. Although Mirage is handy to use, Rena Rouge must use it wisely, as she can only use it once before reverting to her civilian form five minutes after using it.

=== As Rena Rage ===
She retains the same ability as Rena Rouge, as well as the same weapon.

=== As Lady Wifi ===
[[File:LW_S01EP07_(721).png|thumb|Lady WiFi throws her pause icon.]]
A Wi-Fi signal gives Lady Wifi power, but if the signal is too weak or nonexistent, she loses her abilities. She uses her [[Alya's cellphone|cellphone]], which is the [[List of akumatized objects|akumatized object]], as her weapon. Swiping her phone, she can shoot out glowing pink icons, to wit: 
* The '''pause''' and '''stop''' icons, which can freeze people.
* The '''padlock''' icon, which can lock doors, and bind body parts to a surface.
* The '''camera''' icon, which she uses to film and broadcast videos that she can project in the sky and on all available screens.
*The '''fast forward''' icon, which acts like a hoverboard as a mode of transportation. This is first shown in &quot;[[The Puppeteer]]&quot;.
She is also able to dispel any of the currently in-use icons by crossing them off using her cellphone.

Additionally, Lady Wifi can teleport herself using cell phones and antennas.

Even without her phone abilities, Lady Wifi is skilled in hand-to-hand combat, easily being able to pin Cat Noir down on the ground. In &quot;The Puppeteer&quot;, Lady Wifi is also shown to be remarkably strong, easily lifting an entire wooden chest and throwing it across the room at Ladybug.

=== As Oblivio ===
Oblivio has super strength and wields a laser cannon that can fire a blast of purple energy that causes whoever it hits to lose their memories.

==Trivia==
* Alya's name is derived from the R&amp;B singer [[wikipedia:Aaliyah|Aaliyah]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/847194341273718785 Thomas Astruc via Twitter] 29 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; just as the rest of her family's names are references to jazz singers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/MiraculousThomasAstruc/posts/1003852316417217&lt;/ref&gt;
** In Slavonic, &quot;Alya&quot; means &quot;beautiful&quot; or &quot;scarlet,&quot; possibly a reference to her red-brown hair. In Arabic, &quot;Alya&quot; means &quot;sky,&quot; &quot;heaven,&quot; or &quot;loftiness.&quot;
* In the Serbian dub, her name is changed to Ajla Sezar.
* Alya is the most recurring supporting character of the series, appearing in nearly every episode, alongside Marinette, Adrien, Hawk Moth, [[Tikki]], and [[Plagg]].
* [[File:Old Mime Storyboard 4.jpg|thumb|180px|Alya asking Marinette about her superpowers in older storyboards.]]Unlike in the final product, Alya knew that Marinette was Ladybug in the early concept of the show.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BT7kJiShEUe/&lt;/ref&gt;
* In older concept art, Alya didn't wear glasses but instead wore sunglasses on top of her head.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/757503403736064001&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lady Wifi made the most appearances of any akumatized villain in the first season.
** In &quot;The Evillustrator&quot;, she reappears in [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg|Nathaniel]]'s fantasy, teaming up with Stormy Weather to attack Marinette.
** In &quot;The Puppeteer&quot;, she makes her third appearance while being controlled by the [[Manon Chamack|titular villain]].
* She is the first villain that manages to remove a [[Miraculouses|Miraculous]] from one of the heroes without making it disappear, as Cat Noir drops his ring when she throws him into a freezer. However, she is unaware of the success as she focuses on Ladybug at the time.
**The next to do so was the [[Mr. Damocles|titular villain]] in the episode, &quot;The Dark Owl&quot;.
* Her family comes from Martinique, which is possibly a reference to Aimé Césaire.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
* Despite the statement in &quot;Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)&quot; that Alya was a new student at the school and didn't know any of the school's students beforehand, in &quot;Darkblade&quot;, she says that Chloé may have been Class Representative since kindergarten.
* In [[Season 2]] and later comics, Alya has more interactions with Nino.&lt;ref&gt;http://whatitdobugaboo.tumblr.com/post/147862332334/thomas-confirmed-there-will-be-more-alya-x-nino&lt;/ref&gt;
* News of Alya appearing as a superhero in an upcoming season was first released at Anime Expo 2016 during the Miraculous Ladybug panel.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;
** It was confirmed again at the panel at [[wikipedia:San Diego Comic Con|San Diego Comic Con]] 2016, along with revealing her debut to be in Season 2.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
** Rena Rouge's identity was later revealed to be Alya at the Miraculous panel at New York Comic Con 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;
** Her superhero name was revealed at a TFOU press conference on August 31, 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;
** Alya's role as the future holder of the [[Fox Miraculous]] was foreshadowed in the [[It's Ladybug|second opening]]. In which Alya was shown with a fox emoji.
* The final concept design of Rena Rouge was revealed at the New York Toy Fair 2017 as a preview for a fashion doll and action doll of her.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Ladybug_Cartoon/status/850443243686899712&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rena Rouge means &quot;Red Fox&quot; in French, as Rena is short for ''renarde'', which is French for &quot;fox,&quot; and ''rouge'' is the French word for &quot;red.&quot;
** Alternatively, ''rena'' could also be referring to the word for &quot;fox&quot; in Haitian-Creole.
** In the Italian dub, she is called ''Volpe Rossa'' which also means &quot;Red Fox&quot;.
** In the dub for Portugal, she is called &quot;Fox Rouge&quot; which, like Cat Noir, is a combination between the English &quot;fox&quot; and French &quot;rouge&quot; for &quot;red&quot;.
* [[Lila Rossi]], during her [[akumatization]] as Volpina, can create hyper-realistic illusions by playing her flute, mirroring Rena Rouge's ability to create illusions, similar to how [[Théo Barbot|Théo]] and [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]]'s akumatized forms' skills mirror those of Cat Noir and Ladybug respectively.
** However, while Volpina can create multiple illusions without losing power and detransforming, Rena Rouge can only make one illusion per transformation and transforms back after five minutes.
* According to a synopsis on Le Figaro, [[Wang Fu|Master Wang Fu]] would call on Rena Rouge.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;
* Alya is the first person to become an akumatized villain and a Miraculous holder, excluding [[Gabriel Agreste]], who akumatized himself.
* As revealed in &quot;Syren&quot;, Alya still gets called on by Ladybug to be Rena Rouge from time to time, but she always gives back the Fox Miraculous when she’s done.
* Similar to Cat Noir, Rena Rouge's ears and tail are fake, but it is unknown if they respond to her mood and emotions, or if they can enhance senses.
* As Rena Rouge, her body is slimmer than her civilian form, and her hair is longer and goes up in a ponytail.
* Ladybug presents the [[Bee Miraculous]] to Alya in &quot;Style Queen&quot; but she is turned into a glitter statue before she can accept it.
* When Alya and Nino become Oblivio, their supervillain name is a pun on the word oblivious.
* Alya has her own official Instagram account. You can find her under nick [https://www.instagram.com/alya.ladyblogger/ @alya.ladyblogger].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/1152334692370309128&lt;/ref&gt;
** She mentions starting a bullet journal in one of her Instagram pictures.
** Due to her dad's job at the zoo on occasion he lets Alya and her friends or family in after hours.  
** She doesn't only search for information about Ladybug and Cat Noir she also started looking for information on other Miraculous heroes.
{{HideSpoiler|
* Like Kagami with the Dragon Miraculous, Alya is the only holder to solely use the Fox Miraculous.
* She is tied with Chloe as they are the only ones of the French Miraculous superhero team to be akumatized the most with a total of four times.}}

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Aurore is a slender teenage girl standing at medium height with fair skin, blue eyes and blonde hair with bangs and low hanging twintails tied with light blue hair ties.

=== Civilian attire ===
She wears thick-heeled yellow dress shoes and a light blue mini dress that has small shoulder puffs, a small yellow cloud pattern, a white collar, a white band around the waist, frills at the hem, and small white lace at the dress openings. She carries a parasol that is blue with a white cloud pattern on the outside and light yellow on the inside.

=== As Stormy Weather ===
Stormy Weather has pale skin and light purple-gray eyes. Her hair is two tones with dark purple base and periwinkle bangs, while her large, pointed, low-angled twintails are striped with dark purple and periwinkle spirals. On her face, she has jagged black face paint that surrounds her eyes and comes down to her cheeks as lightning bolts.

She wears a tight, muted-color purple and blue two-piece dress that poofs into a curved bell-shape around her waist, has small shoulder puffs with a narrow-ended-tube-shaped collar, and also features 5 white lightning bolt patterns that have bright purple outlines. The sleeves become white gloves with two of the lighting bolts above her elbows. She wears muted purple tights that become small-heeled white boots that are angled at the &quot;opening&quot; near the calf, and two of the lightning bolts come out of the boots around the outsides of her legs near the knees (the last of the pattern is a sole lightning bolt centered squarely near her abdomen). Her [[List of akumatized objects|weapon]] is a closed dark purple parasol that fades to brighter purple at the tip and has a black handle with a double spearhead at the bottom.

{{For2|more of Aurore's outfits and designs|Aurore Beauréal/Designs}}

== Personality ==
Normally, Aurore is charming and prideful. Because of her arrogance, she is angry with Mireille for winning instead of her, but she keeps it to herself, only lamenting about it once she is alone.

When she is Stormy Weather, she becomes a lot more out loud about her aggressive and rude feelings. Her jealousy for Mireille ramps up even higher, as she traps Mireille with ice in an elevator, destroys any images of her, and attacks her fans.


== Relationships ==
=== [[Mireille Caquet]] ===
Aurore competes with Mireille for the title of Kidz+ TV weather girl. When Mireille wins instead of her, Aurore is very angry, though she keeps it to herself and only laments about it once she's alone. As Stormy Weather, her resentment for Mireille grows as she traps her in a block of ice and destroys anything that has an image of her. It is unknown if they are friends now.

It's shown as of &quot;Ikari Gozen&quot; the two seem to get along as they both host the Friendship Day game.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
Aurore becomes very angry at Chloé when she makes fun of her low grade point average and akumatized powers, causing her to get akumatized once again. As Stormy Weather, she traps Chloé in a block of ice because of this.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] ===
Aurore is grateful towards Marinette when she stands up for her after Chloé makes fun of her and tells her to ask for help if she needs it.}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
With her parasol as her weapon, Stormy Weather is able to control the weather. She can control air and create strong wind; this also allows her to levitate, fly at high speeds and create small hurricanes. She can create ice and freeze air currents, along with forming snowstorms and hailstorms. She can fire purple lightning bolts from her parasol that cause small explosions on impact. Also, she can aim them towards the sky; by doing that, the sky clouds up and, after a few seconds, a massive lightning strikes.

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;Stormy Weather 2&quot;, Stormy Weather's powers become expanded to include &quot;all the forces of nature&quot;. Consequently, she is able to create a volcano which generates enough force to move Earth out of its orbit. Ladybug notes during the battle that she's far stronger than she was before.}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are divine, sprite-like beings who embody &quot;abstract&quot; concepts. They give certain powers to [[Miraculous holders|people]] with [[Miraculouses]], transforming them into animal-themed super beings.


== History ==
[[File:Kwamis_Traveling_the_Universe.png|thumb|left|424x424px|Kwamis flying through the universe.]]
As explained by [[Wang Fu]], [[Wayzz]], and [[Tikki]] in the [[Miraculous Adventures Issue 2|second issue]] of [[Miraculous Adventures|''Miraculous Adventures'']], kwamis are formed whenever a new abstract idea or emotion comes into existence in the universe, such as creation, love, beauty, and mathematics. These emotions can come into being at different times, such as the kwami of creation, Tikki, who was formed at the beginning of the universe and thus was the first kwami to exist.

All kwamis know each other and were able to journey across the universe for a very long time.&lt;ref&gt;Feri González [https://curiouscat.me/MiraculousMX/post/257059211 confirmed this] this on her [https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/942464414795608064 Curious Cat account]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the kwamis couldn't be sensed by regular tangible creatures like humans and thus were unable to interact with them. The issue was resolved thousands of years ago, when a [[Unnamed mage|Chinese mage]] figured out how to create magical jewels, [[Miraculouses]], in order for the kwamis to be able to communicate with people.

From that point on, kwamis helped the wearers of their Miraculouses achieve good around all the world, although there were instances where they became stuck with villainous holders and were forced to help them with their diabolical schemes due to being bound to their holder's every command. Some of them have made long lasting and meaningful bonds of friendship with their holders and to commerate that special bond they'd give their holders a jewel called a Kwagatama.

A long time ago (even enough for some kwamis to forget), they were blocked by a magical spell that prevents them from speaking the name of their owners so they wouldn't be allowed to say their holder's real name to other kwamis.

{{HideSpoiler|And also prevents them from saying it to other Miraculous holders.}}

All kwamis know the Guardian of the Miraculous but aren't allowed to reveal him to their wielders except in a great emergency, as in &quot;[[Princess Fragrance]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Collector]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Syren]]&quot;. Kwamis all feel a sense of familiarity with the [[Miraculous spellbook]] when they see it, implying a certain past with it.

Even though kwamis are familiar with the book, they don't know how to read it, as revealed by [[Nooroo]] in &quot;Syren&quot;. This is because kwamis must never know the spells that are inside the book, which is meant as a precaution should a kwami fall into the wrong hands. Also, according to Tikki, kwamis aren't allowed to leave their Miraculous wielder's side in case someone becomes akumatized.

In &quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;, active kwamis collect items from the outside world inside the [[Miracle Box]], to serve as presents to inactive ones for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/1044609037231362048&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
Generally, kwamis are small, being around 10 centimeters (or 4 inches) in height, with large heads and tiny bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Confirmed to [[User:BelieveInMagic814]] by the official [https://officialmiraculousladybug.tumblr.com/ Miraculous Ladybug Tumblr blog].&lt;/ref&gt; They have arms and legs, but they lack fingers and toes yet are still able to lift things. The animal theme that they display is reflected in their Miraculous; for example, [[Plagg]] is black with green eyes, cat-like ears, and a cat-like tail, thus fittingly his Miraculous is the [[Cat Miraculous]].

After consuming certain potions made from the Miraculous spellbook their appearances will change. If the aqua mode potion is used, the kwami will gain fins and a tail. In &quot;ice mode&quot;, the kwamis gain crystals on their bodies.

== Abilities ==
[[File:OR-2_(1040).png|thumb|left|Wayzz levitating next to Master Wang Fu.]]
Kwamis can become intangible to pass through solid objects, like locker doors or chains. In &quot;The Collector&quot;, it is noted that they aren't able to be filmed or photographed, not showing up in photos and videos to prevent others from discovering their existence. Normally, kwamis can fly and levitate, even at high speeds, as shown by Plagg &lt;ref&gt;[[Sandboy]], [[Style Queen (Queen's Battle - Part 1)]]&lt;/ref&gt;. As well as at high altitudes, as shown by Tikki &lt;ref&gt;As shown in &quot;[[Weredad]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Even though they are small, kwamis appear to have enough strength to hold things that are larger and/or heavier than themselves.

[[File:CNTS 17.png|thumb|Plagg helping Adrien transform.|196x196px]]

Kwamis inhabit pieces of Miraculous jewelry in order to give the person wearing them the ability to transform into superheroes and gain a [[Miraculous superpowers|specific power]] based of the abstract idea or emotion that made the kwami come into existence, such as Trixx granting the power of illusion via [[Mirage]]. They are aware of the actions of the people who possess their Miraculous when transformed, but they cannot communicate with their holders at such times.&lt;ref&gt;https://mobile.twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/704623675702714368&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Plagg laughs at how [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]] said rude things to Ladybug when he was possessed by [[Lê Chiến Kim|Dark Cupid]]'s arrow. At the same time, the extent they can be aware what is happening when their Miraculous is used is uncertain: in &quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)|Ladybug &amp;amp; Cat Noir]]&quot;, Tikki and Plagg appear to be unaware of whether or not the [[akuma]] was captured. And yet, in &quot;Style Queen&quot;, Tikki was aware of the effects of the magic ladybugs.

[[File:Antibug (947).png|left|thumb|Tikki eating a cookie to regain energy to transform Marinette again.]]

The Miraculous transformation can last indefinitely unless the Miraculous' special power is used, at which point the wearer has about five minutes until they revert to their normal form and the kwami leaves the Miraculous.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/653210855102877696&lt;/ref&gt; To regain power, to strengthen themselves, and to transform their wearer again, the kwamis need to refuel by eating food. Some have a preference for specific foods: for instance, Plagg's favorite food is Camembert cheese, but he is willing to eat other types of food if Camembert isn't available for him, preferably some kind of cheese. But when working with an adult holder the kwamis can the transformation even longer. Despite their ages and powers, kwamis can get sick, as seen when Tikki becomes sick after helping [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] defeat a villain in pouring rain. Wang Fu is able to assist in their recovery and heal them. Despite the fact that they can become ill,  it's unknown if it can only occur while bound to a Miraculous, or to what extent this could harm them or affect their wielders. As abstract entities, they have been around since before the creation of the Miraculouses, meaning even if their Miraculous is destroyed (by [[Cataclysm]]) or erased from the timeline, they will return to their natural state, in which case they cannot be perceived by human senses under normal circumstances; they do not cease to exist.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/1054706013239214080?s=19&lt;/ref&gt; It is also not known if they are truly immortal. Based on their origins, they may live on forever after coming into existence. Also, the ideas, concepts, or emotions that create them are seemingly not bound to other beings, since Tikki was born alongside the universe, and not due to the concept of creation being discovered or realized at a later point in time.

Kwamis also perform a ritual for their Miraculous holders where they create a [[Kwagatama|kwagatama]] inside their bodies from the hairs of their past and current holders. They then present the charm to their current bearer for a special occasion, such as a birthday.

Kwamis can communicate with each other once in every “cycle” on their birthday, if they gather in the Miracle Box at a specific time and sing all together. The more kwamis there are, the stronger the connection. They also can dispel the connection with their hands. If a kwami's powers are active during that time frame, the other kwamis will contact the Miraculous' holder and that person can track them down if they stay connected, this apparently being the only way a kwami's wielder can communicate with them when they're in their world.

Kwamis are able to perform their respective Miraculous holder's power without their jewels, but to a much greater extent which can even turn uncontrollable. This is shown in &quot;[[Style Queen (Queen's Battle - Part 1)|Style Queen]]&quot; when Plagg was able to perform Cat Noir's Cataclysm by coming into direct contact with the [[Eiffel Tower]]'s floor, thus destroying the entire structure as well as severely damaging the [[wikipedia:Pont d'Iéna|Pont d'Iéna bridge]] and [[Tour Montparnasse|Montparnasse Tower]].

When kwamis are fused with their owners they have some level of resistance to an akumatized villain's attacks, as seen in &quot;[[Dark Cupid]]&quot;. However, if their holders are attacked by an akumatized villain's powers and detransform afterwards, the effects will transfer to the kwamis, as seen in &quot;[[Oblivio]]&quot;. Also while transformed with their holders if said powers are used on them, the kwami will be severely weakened after detransforming, as happened with Plagg and Cataclysm in &quot;[[Miraculer]]&quot;.

{{SpoilerButton}}
{{HideSpoiler|
As of recent Season 3 spoilers, since the Miraculouses have the power to fuse together to make a hybrid form of a wielder's suit, it's implied that kwamis are capable of fusing their powers together even though isn't fully known how it's done.}}


=== Power ups ===
&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; widths=&quot;250&quot; crop=&quot;true&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Miraculous potions|Potions]] from the Miraculous spellbook are able to alter a kwamis appearance and form by drinking the potion directly or consuming something that contains it. Besides modifying a kwami's appearance and form, potions also help the wielder get new abilities and appearances in their superhero form, depending on the potion the kwami consumed.
[[File:Potions_contained_in_Bottles.png|thumb|222px|Potions that give Miraculous users special powers: Orange, Red, Purple, Blue (Ice), Yellow, Green (Aqua), and Pink.]]
The known power ups are:
* '''Aqua''' - The kwami's legs are replaced with a fish tail, and their hands are replaced with flippers. It allows the kwami to grant underwater abilities to their holder. The potion's color is green.
** Kwamis seen with the underwater power up: Aqua Tikki, Aqua Plagg
* '''Ice''' - The kwami grows three ice shards somewhere on its body, while in some cases some part of the body, such as Tikki's circular spot, turns into a hexagon. It allows the kwami to grant ice-related power to their holder. The potion's color is light blue.
** Kwamis seen with the ice power up: Stalac Tikki, Plagg Glacier

{{KwamiList}}

== Trivia ==
* The concept of the kwamis was created by Bandai.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/857161955387334656&lt;/ref&gt; A kwami is a &quot;quantic (small) kami.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/670391757713076225&lt;/ref&gt; In Japanese, kami (神) often refers to god or certain kind of spirits.
* [[Wilfried Pain]] noted in a Twitter response that kwamis are &quot;some kind of god&quot; and don't exactly have genders.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/691395682016563201&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned that the kwamis are supposed to look very cute.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/885888532975423488&lt;/ref&gt;
**Nonetheless, in “[[Sandboy]]”, kwamis refer one another ([[Sass]] as an example) as brothers or sisters.
* According to [[Thomas Astruc]] during a ''Miraculous'' panel at Ludicomix 2018, some kwamis being inspired by the [[wikipedia:Chinese zodiac|Chinese zodiac]] signs is because he wants the world to get to know the elements of oriental culture.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousINTL/status/987737108428320769&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pandasuite.com/viewer/2.0.2/59a6c26e48abe6f53a002dc9?t=1] (direct video source [https://data.pandasuite.com/videos/59a3e7def643f27d7300131b-universal_1024_1024_20_main_3-0.mp4 here])&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to Thomas Astruc, the name of every kwami has to be a short name with double letters in it.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/648192126912720896&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nooroo]]'s name, in fact, has two doubles.
* In &quot;[[Timebreaker]]&quot;, Tikki is able to sense her own power in the Ladybug from the future. Similarly, Wayzz is able to sense the power of Nooroo and the [[Butterfly Miraculous]] in &quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)]]&quot;.
* Kwamis are like [[wikipedia:Aladdin|Aladdin]]'s genie, having to obey their holders' desires.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Astruc at Japan Weekend, as reported by a fan Twitter account: https://twitter.com/Ladybug_Cartoon/status/780065249101774848&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As shown in &quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; They aren't genies themselves; however, genies do exist in-universe, according to Plagg in &quot;Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir&quot;.
* It is unknown if kwamis can be [[Akumatization|akumatized]], but [[Season 2]] would have the answers, as revealed at the ''Miraculous Ladybug'' panel at [[wikipedia:San Diego Comic-Con|San Diego Comic-Con 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/dramadraws/status/756967147167809536&lt;/ref&gt;
** In &quot;[[Queen Wasp (Queen's Battle - Part 2)|Queen Wasp]]&quot;, kwamis can be akumatized indirectly (except Nooroo himself) if the Miraculous they're inside of becomes the akumatized object.
* If the Miraculous jewel gets destroyed, the kwami reverts to their spirit form, unable to be seen by living beings.
* According to [[Jeremy Zag]], Season 2 would include an episode revealing the origins of the kwamis.&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/n1avxPB4txE?t=161&lt;/ref&gt;
** The [[wikipedia:New York Comic Con|New York Comic Con 2016]] panel additionally noted that there would be ''[[Miraculous Secrets]]'' webisodes that focus on the kwamis, notably Tikki and Plagg (revealed as &quot;[[Tikki (webisode)|Tikki]]&quot; and &quot;[[Plagg (webisode)|Plagg]]&quot;), and that there may be more than one episode in new seasons that centers on them.&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/-UURD3NcjWE?t=1404&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Sandboy&quot; is one such episode.
* The official Miraculous Ladybug Twitter account noted that while more kwamis would be seen in Season 2, it wouldn't be all of them.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/BeMiraculousLB/status/849007498627399680&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Tikki in &quot;Sandboy&quot;, a kwami's cycle or birthday is equivalent to several hundred human years.
* Plagg used his Cataclysm to make the dinosaurs go extinct, but since this happened before the jewels were made, it means that kwamis are capable of using their powers in their spirit forms.
* Even though some kwamis don't have noses they seem to have a sense of smell; for example, in &quot;[[Stormy Weather]]&quot; Plagg said he could &quot;smell Camembert in his sleep.&quot;
** In &quot;[[Oblivio]]&quot;, he was seen sniffing Adrien's shirt, smelling the Camembert within.
* As Miraculouses have been used by people across the world throughout history, it's likely that kwamis are able to understand and speak many, if not all, languages to communicate with their holders.
**This also implies that the phrases used to transform and use their powers can be said in any language.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' was a character from the old, unused concept of [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Félix Agreste|Cat Noir]] being in a team of superheroes called [[Quantic Kids]] along with [[Melodie]] and [[Mercury]], replacing [[Sparrow]]. However, the concept was discarded, so Kid Mime never appeared outside concept art.

He was made to replace Sparrow because producers thought that the [[Fred Haprèle|Mime]] was a great character and they didn't want to keep him as an adult villain only.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/648970732551176197&lt;/ref&gt; He wasn't developed as a character before the superhero team concept was discarded, however.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/653305304088735744&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, it is unknown if Kid Mime exists in the [[Quantic Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoXav4p8zJ4&amp;lc=z124w3x4lnyvxzdrw04chzywfoqvjxsqohw&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==

=== Physical appearance ===
Based on concept art, Kid Mime had dark brown hair and blue eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
In civilian form, he wore a v-neck white and blue striped t-shirt that is solid white on the top and solid blue on the bottom, with a blue shirt underneath. He also wore dark blue jeans.

=== As Kid Mime ===
As a superhero, Kid Mime wore a blue mask with a thick white line underneath each eye. He wore a blue suit that was white from his neck to his shoulders with three blue dots down each side of his neck. There were also white gloves and a white line that went down each side of his body.

== Abilities ==

=== As Kid Mime ===
Much like the Mime, Kid Mime could mime anything, and whatever he mimes will work like a real, solid, yet invisible object.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' was a character from the old, unused concept of [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Félix Agreste|Cat Noir]] being in a team of superheroes called the [[Quantic Kids]]. She existed in concept art that included [[Mercury]] and [[Sparrow]] (who was later replaced with [[Kid Mime]]), other members of the team. However, the concept was discarded, and so, Melodie never appeared outside of concept art.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/648969656166952961&lt;/ref&gt;

It is currently unknown if she exists in the [[Quantic Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoXav4p8zJ4&amp;lc=z124w3x4lnyvxzdrw04chzywfoqvjxsqohw&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==

=== Physical appearance ===
Based on concept art, Melodie had blonde hair that she wore in a single braid except for her bangs. Her eyes were blue.

=== Civilian attire ===
In her civilian form, she wore a white shirt with a purple vest. She also wore dark purple jeans.

=== As Melodie ===
[[Thomas Astruc|Thomas]]'s original early design for Melodie's outfit was a jumpsuit with a white torso and black lower half. On her torso is a massive black treble clef on a staff. At the base of her jumpsuit was a series of white musical notes, which made an infinity symbol. She had white boots and dark gray gloves. Across her face was a white mask.

Later designs tried different features, like a black bent eight note around one of her eyes on the mask, black dots attached to lines on her chest instead of a treble cleft and over her hands, and a white band covering or beside her braid.

== Abilities ==

=== As Melodie ===
Melodie used a flute as a weapon. In concept art, it appears that she could create a narrow line of fire from an end of the flute, which she could fight with.

== Sightings ==

=== Comics and books ===
{{AppearancesCB|LA = yes}}

=== Other ===
{{AppearancesGames|SLL = p}}

== Trivia ==
* An image of Melodie still appears in the ''Super Lady Luck'' slot game.&lt;ref&gt;http://isoftbet.com/launcher/game/start/lady_bug_pmvc/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Like [[Lila Rossi|Volpina]], [[Alya Césaire|Rena Rouge]] and the other Fox Miraculous holders, her weapon is a flute.
* Melodie's civilian design shares many similarities to [[Chloé Bourgeois]]' early designs in  [[:File:HFjHsc6.png|art]], including their hair color, eye color, and apparel.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the daughter of [[Nadja Chamack]] and a girl that [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] babysits. In &quot;[[The Puppeteer]]&quot;, after being accused of stealing one of [[Marinette's dolls]], even though it had actually been lent to her, she is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and becomes the '''Puppeteer''', a body-controlling [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telequebec.tv/les-aventures-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir/epi016ladybug&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[The Puppeteer 2]]&quot;, after feeling ignored during a visit to [[Musée Grévin]] and thinking that nobody wants to play with her, she is akumatized again by Hawk Moth into the Puppeteer, possessing even stronger abilities than before.

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Manon is short with tan skin, messy dark brown hair pulled back into two ponytails, golden-brown eyes, and two upper front buck teeth.

=== Civilian attire ===
She wears a white t-shirt, purple denim overalls with a light purple flower pattern, and red dress shoes with black soles.

=== As the Puppeteer ===
The Puppeteer's skin is purple, and her eyes are pink. Her hair is black, the tips of her ponytails light blue with long white spikes sticking out of each. She wears a black mask over her eyes. She also wears a black fairy dress with a black collar, icy blue-colored shirt top, light blue design and two points at the skirt top, and light blue butterfly sleeves with black edges over black puff sleeves at her shoulders with light blue zigzag ends. Long, black, fingerless gloves adorn her hands. On her legs and feet, she has black leggings. Her wand is black with a black star at the end. The tip of the handle and the tips of the points of the star are icy blues.

{{For2|more of Manon's outfits and designs|Manon Chamack/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:SW (364).png|left|thumb|Manon's using her baby doll eyes.]]
Manon is rambunctious, energetic, stubborn, and naive. She loves to have fun, but she doesn't like it when people don't keep their promises or are being unfair — whether it's in her eyes or it's true. She's also a bit capricious, getting angry when she doesn't get what she wants, and she can be disobedient at times to her mother or her babysitter. She sometimes tries to use baby doll eyes to win others over, although it doesn't always work, while she gets emotional about things she doesn't like, over time, she usually recovers from it in normal circumstances.

Manon is shown to be very brave when she participated in the Paris Rebellion in &quot;Mayura&quot;.

As the Puppeteer, she is greedier and less controlled, wanting things to go the way she believes they should. While smart with how to use her puppets, she still thinks and acts like her young age. She is impatient and throws fits of anger when searching for the dolls.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
If Manon wants something very badly, like a balloon or doll, she is skilled at using her &quot;baby doll eyes&quot; expression to attempt and convince a person. Seen in &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, Manon is very fast for someone her age being able to outrun Marinette for a while and can be pretty stealthy.

=== As the Puppeteer ===

TPT_(1135).png|Puppeteer with the dolls and Lady Wifi.
TPT_(1027).png|Puppeteer and her doll-controlled army.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Puppeteer zaps light blue energy with her wand at a doll of a person. It rises into the air, and then she zaps it again, commanding it to come to life. The person that doll is based on becomes her real-life puppet, which she controls with the doll, similar to how voodoo dolls work. If the Puppeteer wants to, she can speak through the doll, and the real-life person will say the same thing. As for the puppet's actions and movements, she either does it herself, or she tells them what to do and they follow her order without her direct control.

A quirk of her power is that if the doll is based on a person's akumatized villain form, the person transforms back into the villain with a wave of light blue energy, and they regain all of their powers, but they also keep their weaknesses, as Lady Wifi's powers went off when Cat Noir destroyed the Wi-Fi antenna on top of the [[Tom &amp; Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie|bakery]].

The Puppeteer can fly and hover. She is also able to use telekinesis to keep the puppets floating and moving with her after she has zapped them.

In &quot;Puppeteer 2&quot;, her power increases, allowing her to bring wax figures to life and control them using her wand, including only parts of them. Any wax figure that represents someone with superpowers will get those same powers.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:TPT (34).png|left|thumb|Marinette and Manon playing with Marinette's dolls.]]

Manon enjoys Marinette as a babysitter, but she doesn't always like to obey Marinette's requests or respect her actions. She is willing to use her baby-doll eyes on Marinette if she wants something badly enough, and she is upset when Marinette wins while they are playing dolls. However, she doesn't have any bad intentions towards her, and she will agree with her ideas in particular cases. She even attends Marinette's birthday party in &quot;Befana&quot; with Marinette's other friends. During &quot;The Puppeteer 2&quot;, she comes with Marinette and her friends to the wax museum.

With Ladybug, Manon appreciates her and her heroism. When Ladybug shows up and Marinette goes temporarily missing in &quot;[[Stormy Weather]]&quot;, she concludes that Marinette and Ladybug are best friends that confide with each other on their actions.
In &quot;Mayura&quot;, Manon participated in the Paris Rebellion showing her bravery and support towards Ladybug.

As the Puppeteer, she lets out her frustration of losing with dolls by planning to defeat Ladybug in order for a win against her.

=== [[Nadja Chamack]] ===
[[File:TPT (1339).png|thumb|Manon giving her mother a goodbye kiss.]]
Manon loves her mother deeply, and she usually obeys her. Despite this, she doesn't always like it when her mother doesn't allow her to do what she wants. In &quot;[[Prime Queen]]&quot;, Manon wishes mother the best of luck when working on her tv show with Ladybug and Cat Noir.

In &quot;[[Gamer 2.0]]&quot;, Manon spends time with her mother at the park and they embrace each other after Ladybug returns everything to normal.

=== [[Alya Césaire]] ===
Manon meets Alya in &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, and she warms up to her quickly. She isn't sure whether or not to believe that Alya is a unicorn from the Planet Rispa in human form, but she comes to like playing with her and listening to her stories.

== Trivia ==
* In 2015, Manon was the most popular baby name for French females.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.mom365.com/2015/12/pregnancy/baby-names/2015-top-french-baby-names/&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Serbian dub, her name is changed to Mia.
* In the Slovenian dub, her name is changed to Moni.
* Manon is the youngest character to be akumatized in Season 1.
** As of Season 2, she is the second youngest character after [[August]] from &quot;Gigantitan&quot;.
* According to [[Wilfried Pain]], if a person's doll is brought to life and the person is halfway across the world, the person will still become a puppet and still try to make their way to the Puppeteer.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/696357459196305409&lt;/ref&gt;
* Despite missing the Ladybug doll and not being at full power, at least in Season 1, the Puppeteer can be considered the strongest akumatized villain seen so far in the series.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/696459886226468864&lt;/ref&gt;
**This also reflects the fact that, despite other villains like [[Mr. Damocles|Dark Owl]] and [[Penny Rolling|Troublemaker]] managing to get at least one of Ladybug's earrings, Puppeteer was inches away of controlling both Ladybug and Cat Noir, thus giving the victory to Hawk Moth.
**As of &quot;Party Crasher&quot;, Puppeteer becomes the second akumatized villain to be the closest of getting Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses and give them to Hawk Moth, as Party Crasher was able to capture the two main superheroes, despite the fact that he failed to deliver them to Hawk Moth.
* Chamack is close into the word চমক (Camaka) which means &quot;Amazement&quot; in Bangla/Bengali.
* In &quot;Gamer 2.0&quot;, she was shown to be able to control Copycat despite only having a Cat Noir doll.

{{Quote|Spoke too soon, Kim! Your ridiculous bets are over. I'm gonna leave you in the dust, meathead!|Alix|&quot;[[Timebreaker]]&quot;|quotelink = yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/653848134465007617&lt;/ref&gt; is a student in [[Miss Bustier's class]] at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://miraculeusecoccinelle.tumblr.com/post/129733355946/miraculous-les-aventures-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[Timebreaker]]&quot;, after Alix's birthday gift, a special [[Alix's watch|pocket watch]], is accidentally destroyed, she is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Timebreaker''', a time travelling [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;[[Timetagger]]&quot;, it's revealed that Alix will receive the [[Rabbit Miraculous]] in the future. When the Miraculous is inhabited by [[Fluff]] she becomes '''Bunnyx''', a rabbit-themed superhero.}}

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Alix is short and lean with blue eyes and messy bob-cut pink hair that, on the right side is partially tied into a small side ponytail.

{{HideSpoiler|In the future she becomes much taller and she has dyed her hair red with black tips, which is now styled into a pixie cut.}}

=== Civilian attire ===
Alix wears a black cap with a black old English S logo that is outlined in white on the front. She wears a black long-sleeved, slate gray shirt underneath a dark brown tank top. Each sleeve has a lime green scale patterned fabric snake, starting from her shoulders and coiling around her arms until their heads stop at her wrists. She also wears black jean shorts with pink stitching and black lace at the cuffs, black 1/2 hose length socks with two pink horizontal stripes, and black high top shoes with pink lace, black and lime green checkered sides with a wavy orange line over it, and white soles.

=== As Timebreaker ===
Timebreaker wears a black helmet with red spiked edges on the back and two green eye shields over each eye. She also wears a nearly black suit with lime green patches around her waist, around her lower hips and upper legs, and below her knees. Below her back of her wrists, there are glowing lime green ovals, and on her chest, there is a glowing red hourglass shape within a larger silver outline. Her roller blades are black with two glowing white wheels on each one and a thin green line about the foot's ball and instep.

== Personality ==
[[File:DB S01EP12 (131).png|left|thumb|Alix telling Marinette she doesn't care about being class representative.]]
Alix is a tomboy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Tough, stubborn, reckless, and self-confident, she isn't afraid of challenges or saying what is on her mind. At the same time, she can be kind and grateful, like when her [[Mr. Kubdel|father]] gives her the family heirloom and when [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] fixes it after it breaks. She can become emotional and hold resentment toward others if someone goes wrong because of them, like with her watch. After the akuma is defeated, she realizes her own fault of not taking better care of the watch, and she tells Ladybug that she'll be more responsible with it.

[[File:FN_(652).png|thumb|Alix joins in on the girls' group hug.]]
Alix can be supportive and affectionate towards her friends as seen in &quot;[[Zombizou]] &quot;, where she joined in on Rose and Juleka's group hug after Ladybug returned everything to normal, or in &quot;[[Frightningale]]&quot;, where she praised Marinette for her giving up her chance to perform with Adrien and cheered for her when she rehearsed with him.

Alix is also helpful towards others as seen in &quot;[[Reverser]]&quot;, where she sees Ladybug and Cat Noir's condition and insists on helping the heroes defeat the villain. She also gives Nathaniel some advice about Marc.

{{HideSpoiler|As a grown up Bunnyx, Alix is still full of self-confidence as she believed she could defeat Timetagger on her own. And yet she is more humble admitting when she can't do things by herself, growing out being reckless. She is still tough and very determined as well as clever, seen when she left a clue for Ladybug and Cat Noir to find her in the past. She seems to be pretty understandable with the powers she given.}}

As Timebreaker, her rage increases to the desire of revenge without regret against her classmates. She is very determined to fix her watch, and she doesn't care about anyone that she takes energy from to do so, even taking advantage of [[Rose Lavillant]]'s kindness. While wanting to succeed, Timebreaker is willing to retreat if it means a better chance. Despite this, her overconfidence in her abilities is her downfall when she assumes the present and future Ladybugs aren't clever enough to stop her.


== Abilities ==

=== As a civilian ===
Alix is exceptionally fast and skilled at rollerblading. She is very confident about this, and races [[Lê Chiến Kim]] in ''Timebreaker''.
As seen in ''Reverser'', she does graffiti art, showing signs of talent in art.

{{HideSpoiler|
=== As Bunnyx ===
Bunnyx has enhanced physical characteristics such as strength, speed and agility. Like Ladybug and Cat Noir she is skilled in hand to hand combat and can use her umbrella in combat as well when it's not being used it's attached to her back.

Her special superpower, [[Burrow]] allows her to create portals that can traverse through time. By advancing in time a few seconds, she can simulate teleportation. Notably, she can utilize this ability multiple times without necessitating detransformation, a testament of adult Bunnyx's skill as a Miraculous holder.}}

=== As Timebreaker ===
Timebreaker becomes much faster at rollerblading. She also gets the power to absorb life energy from people by touching them with the palm of her hand. She is not above exploiting compassion in order to lure a target close enough to drain them, in this case, she called out to Rose for help when knocked down. Once their energy is stolen, the affected person becomes frozen and starts to fade from existence. The energy is stored inside her [[List of akumatized objects|rollerblades]], and the more Timebreaker has, the faster and stronger she gets. Timebreaker is also able to use her energy to go back in time; the number of minutes she's able to rewind depends on how many people she freezes and how much energy they give.

== Family ==
{{Kubdel Tree}}


== Relationships ==
=== [[Mr. Kubdel]] ===
[[File:Timebreaker_(107).png|thumb|Alix spends time with her father on her birthday.]]
Alix appears to have an amicable relationship with her father, as seen in &quot;Timebreaker&quot;. She doesn't care about formalities like he does, and while she thanks him for the watch, it takes him showing her its special feature before she understands its importance and becomes grateful for it. When she realizes her dare with Kim is coming up, she also doesn't mind choosing to spend time with him on her birthday over spending time with her friends in order to not bail on him.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:GT_(45).png|thumb|left|Alix agrees to help Marinette get closer to Adrien.]]
The two girls get along together, although Alix is upset for a while with Marinette and everyone else involved with her watch being destroyed. When asked why she isn't running for class representative in &quot;[[Darkblade]]&quot;, Alix, annoyed, turns the question around and asks Marinette why she isn't running. Alix cares for Marinette enough to risk her life to team up with her classmates and protect her from [[Gina Dupain|Befana]]. While not a huge fan of romantic schemes, because she is aware of Marinette's crush on Adrien, she joins with other classmates to set up a romantic encounter for her with him in &quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot;. In &quot;Frightningale&quot;, Alix shows affection by joining in the group hug with the girls and Marinette, twice, showing that she does appreciate Marinette's kindness as a friend. In &quot;[[Reverser]]&quot;, she knows Marinette would never embarrass anyone on purpose.

[[File:Timebreaker_(1407).png|thumb|Alix is delighted when Ladybug gives her the watch back.]]
As for Ladybug, Alix appreciates her and her relentless work against supervillains. As Timebreaker, she originally wants Ladybug out of her way so she can travel back in time, but after Ladybug ruins her chance to save her watch, she and the past Alix shift the blame solely on her for getting the watch broken. After being reverted back to normal and seeing that Ladybug fixed her watch, though, Alix takes responsibility for the broken watch and joyfully thanks her.

In &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot;, like everyone else she sees Ladybug as the key to fixing everything when she bravely sacrifices herself so Ladybug and the others can escape. In &quot;[[Reverser]]&quot;, with Ladybug being clumsy and with an easily spooked Cat Noir, she volunteers to help the weakened heroes stop the villain.

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;Timetagger&quot;, Alix comes across Ladybug with a message for her through her family watch by solving the riddle she becomes ecstatic that not only does she get to meet her future self but also finds out that she'll be called upon by the heroine to become the Rabbit Miraculous holder one day.}}

=== [[Alya Césaire]] ===
[[File:Syren_(528).png|thumb|left|Alix cynically asks Alya if they’re saved.]]
Alix appears to be friends with Alya, as they both treat each other nicely. She entrusted her watch to her while she competed with Kim in &quot;Timebreaker&quot;, but was upset upon finding the watch broken. But she doesn't seem to bear any ill towards Alya after this. She does also accept her invitations to hang out, such as in &quot;Gigantitan&quot;. They both are at the movies with their friends in &quot;Syren&quot;, and Alix sarcastically remarks to Alya if they're 'saved' now since Marinette said she would get help. She also comes with the girls to the audition in &quot;Frightningale,&quot; and shares a group hug with Alya and the girls.

=== [[Rose Lavillant]] and [[Juleka Couffaine]] ===
[[File:GT_(155).png|thumb|Alix tells Rose that she finds it creepy that Marinette knows so much about Adrien.]]
Alix gets along nicely with Rose and Juleka. While a bit more down to earth and tomboyish than they are, she does enjoy spending time with them. Juleka and Rose come to see her compete with Kim on her birthday in &quot;Timebreaker&quot; and cheer for her to win. Alix willingly comes to the photoshoot in &quot;[[Reflekta]]&quot; to support Juleka. She hid behind Juleka in &quot;Horrificator&quot; while investigating the school. When setting up a date for Marinette and Adrien in &quot;Gigantitan&quot;, she agrees with Rose that boys usually are clueless when it comes to love, and snidely mentions how she finds it creepy that Marinette knows everything about Adrien.

In &quot;Zombizou&quot;, Alix holds an infected Rose back so the others won't be infected. At the end of the episode, she hugs Rose and Juleka. They've also hung out in other instances, like in &quot;Syren&quot; as she sits next to them at the movies. In &quot;Frightningale&quot; they audition to be extras in the music video 'Miraculous', and Juleka puts her hands on Alix's shoulder while waiting in line, and Alix leans on Juleka while the girls are laughing.

=== [[Lê Chiến Kim]] ===
[[File:Timebreaker_(300).png|thumb|left|Alix and Kim compete.]]
Alix often competes with Kim as he challenges her to several of his dares. His most recent dare involved a race around the school to see if he is faster than her rollerblades. Both of them are very competitive with each other and trash talk each other. For example, when Kim is doing push-ups in the [[Miraculous Adventures Issue 2|second issue]] of [[Miraculous Adventures|''Miraculous Adventures'']], Alix taunts him by telling him that he won't make it to the amount of push-ups he is aiming for. Other than that, they do appear to be friends, seen taking a photo with him, Max, and Mr. Damocles in &quot;[[The Dark Owl]]&quot;.

{{HideSpoiler|She does care about his safety, shown in &quot;Syren&quot; when she tries to look for him after he was taken by the titular villain.}}

=== [[Ivan Bruel]] ===
[[File:PX_(15).png|thumb|Alix and Ivan have a pillow fight.]]
Alix and Ivan appear to get along well: they're seen talking to each other in &quot;[[Mr. Pigeon]]&quot;
and in &quot;Timebreaker&quot;, Ivan was part of the crowd cheering for her during the race. In “[[Pixelator]]&quot;, they have a pillow fight while on a work experience field trip at [[Le Grand Paris]]. She also asks Ivan in surprise about him not remembering being akumatized and attacking Paris in &quot;[[Stoneheart (Origins - Part 2)|Stoneheart]]”.

=== [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg]] ===
Alix appears to be close friends with Nathaniel, as seen in &quot;Reverser&quot;. When Nathaniel mistakenly believes that Marc and Marinette played a joke on him, he explains the situation to Alix, who helps him realize that maybe he was mistaken.

== Trivia ==
{{SpoilerButton}}
* Alix may be a play on Alice from ''Alice in Wonderland''. 
* In the French version, Alix's villain name is Chronogirl.
* In the Serbian dub, her name is changed to Aleks.
* Originally, Alix was supposed to be in a trio with [[Chloé Bourgeois]] and [[Sabrina Raincomprix]], which was a reference to the trio (Sam, Clover, and Alex) from ''Totally Spies!''.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/674293643944067072&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alix's family are of Berber origin.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/858703064420802560&lt;/ref&gt;
* She is the shortest student in [[Miss Bustier's class]].
* She is the first villain in the show to kill a hero, [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]], by touching him while he is protecting Ladybug — although Ladybug goes back in time and prevents this outcome from happening again.
** This also may count as the first known death of a [[Kwamis|kwami]] and a [[Miraculouses|Miraculous]], as [[Plagg]] is in the [[Cat Miraculous|ring]] for Adrien to be Cat Noir.
* Alix's past self was transformed before she accepted Hawk Moth's deal.
* As seen in &quot;Darkblade&quot;, she doesn't care much for class elections.
* She turns 15 in the episode &quot;Timebreaker&quot;.
* Alix's birthday is in April, suggesting that her astrological zodiac sign is Aries or Taurus.
** And her birthstone is Diamond.
** According to the timeline since &quot;Timebreaker&quot;, takes place in the Spring 2015 and Alix turns 15 by then that's means her Chinese zodiac sign is the dragon along with Adrien and Kagami.
* In the first issue of ''Miraculous Adventures'', Alix is on a lacrosse team with Adrien, Ivan and Kim.
* As implied in &quot;Reverser&quot;, Alix goes to the art class to express herself through street art.
* Scarlet Timebreaker reappears in the two-part special event &quot;[[Heroes' Day]]&quot;.
{{HideSpoiler|
* Alix's role as the future holder of the [[Rabbit Miraculous]] was foreshadowed in the [[It's Ladybug|second opening]]. In which Alix was shown with a rabbit ears and snout. As well as in the Miraculous Webisode &quot;Friends&quot;.
* Alix's power as Bunnyx is similar to the one she has as Timebreaker, as they both allow her to travel through time. However, her time traveling power as Bunnyx doesn't require her to steal the life energy from others to travel through time.
* As of &quot;Timetagger&quot;, Alix Kubdel is the fifth person to become a Miraculous holder and an akumatized villain, excluding Gabriel Agreste who akumatized himself.
* Bunnyx, Alix's future superhero identity, has a watch also making a reference to the White Rabbit from ''Alice in Wonderland''.
*Her Timebreaker suit makes the same noise as the [[w:c:ben10:Prototype Omnitrix|Prototype Omnitrix]], which is a broken watch like the [[Rabbit Miraculous]], which is also capable of holograms, transformations, and, through transforming, time travel.
*So far she's the only super hero who's power shares similarities to her power from when she was akumatized, with both Timebreaker and Bunnyx having the power to travel through time.}}

{{SpoilerButton}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/BeMiraculousLB/status/953347465830256641 &quot;#TransformationTuesday featuring our favorite grumpy, 2d Promotional Video boy: Felix Agreste. #MiraculousLadybug&quot; [http://archive.is/FXMgW archive]&lt;/ref&gt; was the original version of Cat Noir that was seen in the [[Ladybug PV]]. He was replaced by [[Adrien Agreste]] in the main series.

== Appearance ==

=== Physical Appearance ===
Félix was tall with pale blonde, combed-back hair and light blueish-gray eyes.

=== Civilian Attire ===
In civilian form, he wore a light gray long-sleeved dress shirt underneath a gray vest, a black tie, dark gray dress pants, and black dress shoes. On his right middle finger, he wore a black cat-shaped ring with green eyes and a red jewel on its forehead.

=== As Cat Noir ===
Cat Noir wore a black suit with a golden bell on his chest. He had cat ears, a cat tail, claws on his fingers, and a belt around his waist with compartments. Additionally, he wore mid-thigh high boots and a black face mask that covered his eyebrows and his nose. His sclerae were green, and his hair was messier and untamed.

{{For2|more of Félix's outfits and designs|Félix Agreste/Designs}}

== Personality ==

Félix was serious and reserved, keeping to himself and not being openly friendly. He coldly refused Marinette's feelings towards him and he got exasperated with Plagg's troublemaking behavior, as seen when Plagg knocks books off a shelf onto him. He liked to read books and disliked his bad luck, wanting to get rid of his powers to be normal again.

However, as Cat Noir, Félix became wild, outgoing, and expressive, though still being serious and focused when it came to fighting crime. He seemed to get nicer and more optimistic in his transformed state, as well, treating Ladybug kindly in comparison to how he treated others regularly. He tried to seduce Ladybug in order to receive a kiss from her, which would rid him of the &quot;bad luck&quot; from the ring and remove the ring itself from his finger.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;[http://miraculeusecoccinelle.tumblr.com/post/125225098626/on-chat-noir-needing-a-kiss-from-ladybug Explanation] of the kissing element in older concepts (with sources) from Tumblr user miraculeusecoccinelle.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abilities ==

=== As A Civilian ===
[[File:Félix ignoring Marinette.jpg|thumb|Félix using his bad luck on Marinette.]]
The ring's bad luck affected Félix and allowed him to project it onto others, even when he wasn't transformed. For example, in a concept image, he touches a tree, with his hand surrounded by bad luck energy, causing an apple to drop on Marinette's head.

=== As Cat Noir ===
[[File:Cat Noir Black Storm and Black Hole concept art.jpg|left|thumb|Concept art of Black Storm and Black Hole.]]
The specifics of all of Félix's abilities as Cat Noir are unknown, but he appears to have had enhanced skills, such as agility, speed, and strength. His powers that he can utilize in civilian form were also probably available to use when he was transformed.

As seen in concept art in the later stages with Félix, Cat Noir had additional abilities related to his ring. He had Black Storm, where he points his ring out and releases a massive ball of dark energy, and Black Hole, where he puts his right hand on the ground and creates a small hole to capture people.

== Family ==
{{Agreste Tree}}

== Relationships ==

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:PV HQ (10).png|thumb|left|Cat Noir presenting a flower to Ladybug.]]
Félix is immensely irked by Marinette and her crush on him. He seems aware that she likes him, but he doesn't reciprocate her interest, often responding to her by ignoring her, rejecting her invitations, and avoiding her.

When Marinette is Ladybug, Félix romantically pursues her. While trying to get a kiss to remove his powers by flirting with her, he also appears to care deeply about her. Her lack of feelings towards him is exasperating for him, not understanding why she doesn't accept a flower he brings for her. He finds her attractive, being awestruck by her as she leaps by him. When she is fighting the [[Fred Haprèle|Mime]], he watches in concern, and he talks naturally with her as they look over [[Paris]] at the end of the PV.

=== [[Plagg]] ===
In the Ladybug PV, Félix doesn't take kindly to Plagg's mischief, and he is rather impatient with him.

=== [[Quantic Kids]] ===
[[File:Quantic Kids Universe early concept.png|thumb|Félix viewing Marinette and Quantic Kids members as civilians from a distance.]]
It's unknown what Félix's relationship was like with the other Quantic Kids members by the time the idea and team members were dropped, but as seen in concept art when they're in civilian forms, he sits separately from them and Marinette, looking disinterested. When they're transformed, he looks like he gets along with them decently, grinning while with them in a drawing by Thomas Astruc.

== Trivia ==

*Félix was a darker character that [[Thomas Astruc]] created to be [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]]'s love interest and Cat Noir's alter ego, but Félix came off as an anime cliché, and no one, including Thomas, was convinced by his dynamic with Ladybug as a couple of heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas has a few Twitter posts explaining this (the [https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/659174665580081152 first] and the [https://twitter.com/OrangeRux/status/647421010296238080 second]). Also, he posted a [https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/670606890167091200 link] to a [http://marblegreensreviews.tumblr.com/post/134120632411/felix-and-why-adrien-is-the-better-character-and Tumblr post by fan marblegreensreviews] that expresses the reasons why he and the crew dropped Félix.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of an entirely new character, Adrien Agreste, to be Cat Noir.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/646657309360455680&lt;/ref&gt;
**For a while, Thomas considered bringing Félix back at some point, but since then, he doesn't seem to have intentions to use him, eventually outright stating that Félix will never appear.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/OrangeRux/status/647421010296238080&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/698923032044269568&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/752991955148242944&lt;/ref&gt;{{HideSpoiler| However, during [[Season 3]], Adrien's cousin, who is also named Félix would appear in an [[Félix (episode)|episode of the same name]], though it is unknown if the two Félixes are connected.}}
* Originally, Félix was a name that fans called him without knowing his real name. In an early synopsis, his name was confirmed to be Félix, but later on, sources said it was Adrien, confusing fans. It wasn't until later that they learned that Félix had not only been Cat Noir's original civilian name, but also a separate character from Adrien.
** He was named Félix because it means happy/lucky in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/831445336027697152&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Felix Agreste concept art.jpg|thumb|Félix's PV appearance, as showcased in the [[Ladybug Artbook]].]]
* Félix's appearance is very different from the current version of Adrien. Adrien has more casual clothing with a variety of colors, green eyes, darker skin and a less tidy hairstyle. As Cat Noir, Adrien's outfit has lower boots, gloves, and a staff for a weapon.
** Their personalities are also different. Adrien is less reserved and much kinder in his civilian form, and he is nicer to Marinette and is her friend, but oblivious to her feelings for him.
** As opposed to Adrien, Félix's ring cannot come off anytime unless he gets a kiss from Ladybug. In addition, while wearing the ring, Félix is cursed to have bad luck, but it is unknown if this curse or any curse affects Adrien.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
** Félix's cat ears when he transforms are real, unlike Adrien's, whose cat ears are fake.

* When the unused concept of Quantic Kids was in development, Félix was still Cat Noir, as seen in a concept art. He continued to be, even after the Quantic Kids idea was shelved.
* If an anime or 2D version of Ladybug is made, Thomas Astruc has stated that the Cat Noir featured would probably still be Adrien, because Félix isn't a strong enough character to write for on a long term.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Lauren_Jay_/status/665819617282011136&lt;/ref&gt;
** This has been proven to be true, as revealed for the [[Miraculous Ladybug OVA]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/679310947933102080&lt;/ref&gt;
** There are also no plans for any variation of Félix to appear in the current 3D show.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;
* Félix is considered to be a fanon character entirely now, having been dropped since the Toei Animation test, and not planned to ever return again.&lt;ref&gt;Miraculous Meetup on May 17, 2017, said by [[Wilfried Pain]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Felix Agreste's outfit from ''The Mini Menace Ladybug'' looks like the Marvel Comics' character Black Panther.

'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/755033027823046656&lt;/ref&gt; is a student in [[Miss Bustier's class]] at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]]. In &quot;[[Reflekta]]&quot;, after being locked in the bathroom by [[Sabrina Raincomprix]] (under the orders from [[Chloé Bourgeois]]) to prevent Juleka from participating in the class photo, she is infected with an [[akuma]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and becomes '''Reflekta''', a [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]] who turns people into copies of herself. 

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;[[Reflekdoll]]&quot;, after Juleka misses the chance to photo shoot for Marinette's design, she is once again akumatized by Hawk Moth into '''Reflekta''' along with being [[Amokization|amokized]] by [[Nathalie Sancoeur|Mayura]] and her emotions form a doll-themed sentimonster which helps enhances her powers.
&lt;br/&gt;
In &quot;[[Félix (episode)|Félix]]&quot; she is, along with [[Rose Lavillant]] and [[Alya Césaire]], akumatized by Hawk Moth into the '''Trio Of Punishers''', a group of supervillains.}}

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Juleka is a very pretty girl with tailbone-length black hair that has violet tips at the end of her hair with bangs covering the left side of her face and copper eyes. She wears a pale lavender lipstick and her fingernails are painted grey with black nail art of intricate patterns on each one with different designs on each hand. She also stands at a medium height.

=== Civilian attire ===
Juleka wears a black shirt with a swan-necked collar and sea green lined collar and side pockets, and black mesh short sleeves. On her hands, she has black fingerless lace gloves that have a diamond pattern design and end halfway up the forearm. She also wears purple pants with holes above the knees and black high top sneakers with white soles.

=== As Reflekta ===
Reflekta's face is white and she has hot pink circle markings around her eyes, along with purple lipstick. On the tips of her eyelashes, there are small light green spheres. Her hair is shiny and pink with light purple stripes, and two twisted ponytails stick upward on each side of her head. She has side bangs, and at the center of the front of her hair, there is a white upward almond-shaped eye with a light purple outline and a pink pupil. She wears a pink dress with a collaret, light purple stripes around her waist, and eyes like the one on her hair around her puffed sleeves and skirt. The tips of the collaret and the skirt have light pink edging, and her arms and legs have pink gloves and leggings. Her long green fingernails stick out of the end of her gloves, and on the back of her right hand, she has a pink eye design with a black outline, the center being a black jewel that opens up to reveal a small circular mirror. At the bottom of her feet, she has pink thick high heels and miniature eyes without pupils appear above the feet. Her eyes remain copper.

== Personality ==
[[File:HF S01EP11 (617).png|left|thumb|Juleka responding in awe to the Horrificator's roar.]]
Like Marc, Juleka is very timid and nervous around others. She doesn't speak as often as the rest of her classmates, and when she does it is often in a self-conscious mumble. She is rarely particularly expressive, though she will be in some cases, including calling out being through with [[Lê Chiến Kim|Kim]]'s &quot;stupid dares&quot; in &quot;[[Timebreaker]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://miraculeusecoccinelle.tumblr.com/post/129733355946/miraculous-les-aventures-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir&lt;/ref&gt; She seems to like scary things, or be unafraid of such, as she is the only student to not fear [[Mylène Haprèle|Horrificator]], calling her &quot;awesome&quot; in the [[Horrificator|episode of the same name]]. Because of her quiet nature, Juleka feels like no one ever notices her and forgets she is around, but she is aware that there are people that care about her, to whom she expresses compassion and gentleness.

Despite her shyness, Juleka can be brave and supportive towards her friends as seen in &quot;[[Darkblade]]&quot;, &quot;[[Befana]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot;. She can be affectionate with those she is close to where she shares hugs with her friends as seen in &quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot; and &quot;[[Frightningale]]&quot;, or cuddling with Rose in &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot;.

As Reflekta, she is proud and vengeful. Because no one ever paid attention to her, she wants everyone to look like her so that she will never be unnoticed again. In particular, she wants to transform Chloé because she prevented her from being in the class photo. Without a second thought, she is also ruthless, she even transforms people who are nice to her and notice her, including [[Rose Lavillant]]. She is quite vain, constantly telling everyone that they will look better once they look like her and reassures them that they look amazing once they are transformed. Due to this arrogance, she believes her victims like their new looks, when they clearly do not. She is cunning as well, figuring out [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]]'s plan to catch her and persuading a transformed [[André Bourgeois]] that she'll turn him back to normal if he tricks Ladybug and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] into believing he is her.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Juleka seems to be skilled at applying makeup, as she is the makeup artist for [[Nino Lahiffe]]'s short film in &quot;Horrificator&quot;. She also knows how to play guitar and is a guitarist in Kitty Section’s band.

=== As Reflekta ===
&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; widths=&quot;250&quot; crop=&quot;true&quot;&gt;

RK_(584).png|One of Reflekta's copies (Chloé) behind Ladybug.
RK_(412).png|Reflekta lifting a locker.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Reflekta is able to shoot rays from the jewel she has on her right wrist, which transforms people into an identical physical copy of herself. Those transformed by her retain their normal voices and minds but do not have her powers or their own abilities, and they are immune to subsequent hits from her ray. She is implied to be able to reverse the transformations as well, as she says to Hawk Moth that she will take care of getting [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]]'s ring after getting the [[Ladybug Miraculous]], despite having transformed him, and she promises [[André Bourgeois]] that she'll turn him back to normal in exchange for his cooperation.

She also seems to be able to float, as seen when she jumps around, and she is very strong and fast, quickly throwing multiple lockers in front of a door in the span of a couple of seconds and breaking free from a basketball hoop around her body.

== Family ==
{{Couffaine Tree}}

== Relationships ==
=== [[Rose Lavillant]] ===
[[File:Princess_Fragrance_068.png|thumb|Juleka listening to Rose talk about Prince Ali after giving her a tissue.]]

Juleka is best friends with Rose, and Juleka cares about her. While the quieter of the two, Juleka enjoys listening to Rose, like when Rose is gushing about [[Prince Ali]] in &quot;[[Princess Fragrance]]&quot;, and she will speak up for her when it's definitely needed, complimenting Rose's [[Rose's notebook|notebook]] and Rose herself in &quot;[[The Notebook]]&quot;. She doesn't believe Rose about breaking her photo curse in &quot;Reflekta&quot;, and after being locked out of the photo, she sadly tells Rose to forget about her before running away. But later, after Rose and Marinette prove her wrong about the curse, Juleka is deeply happy about it.

In &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot;, Juleka is seen cuddling and comforting Rose after her close call with Zombizou's minions; the two are even holding hands and even share a hug after they are returned to normal. In &quot;Reverser&quot;, they both are a part of the same Art Club. In &quot;Catalyst&quot;, Juleka was shocked when Rose was reakumatized.

They even play Super Penguino together mentioned in &quot;Oblivio&quot;

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:RK_(1009).png|thumb|left|Juleka in a photo with Rose and Marinette.]]
A friend to Marinette, Juleka likes her and her kindness. In &quot;[[Darkblade]]&quot;, Juleka supports Marinette's run as class representative and mumbles an incomprehensible request she would like if Marinette wins. After countless times of bad photos for Juleka, Marinette helps her break the pattern in &quot;Reflekta&quot;, even after Chloé ruins Juleka's attempt to be in the class photo. Getting good pictures of herself and her friends with her at the [[Place des Vosges]], Juleka graciously thanks Marinette for helping her.

In &quot;[[Befana]]&quot;, Juleka finds Marinette cool as she works with her friends to defend her. In &quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot;, Juleka like the others already know that Marinette has a crush on Adrien and approves of it. She works with her friends to help Marinette plan a date with Adrien but when Marinette turns Adrien's offer down, Juleka has confidence in her friend that she'll get there someday.

With Ladybug, Juleka is grateful for the superhero and believes in her ability to save the day with Cat Noir. In &quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot;, she even works with Alya and the others to help Ladybug get out of the villain's grip. As Reflekta, she isn't pleased with Ladybug's interference with her plans, and she works to keep one step ahead of her schemes.

=== [[Alya Césaire]] ===
[[File:LW_S01EP07_(35).png|thumb|Juleka and Rose with Alya.]]
Alya is another one of Juleka's friends. She, Alya, and Marinette work together to cheer up Rose after Chloé upsets her in &quot;[[The Notebook]]&quot;. She also agrees to Alya's plan for them and Rose to help Marinette and her parents finish their large order of macaroons in &quot;[[Busy Day]]&quot;.

As friends Juleka enjoys hanging out with Alya seen in &quot;Gigantitan&quot; where she helped Alya plan a date between Adrien and Marinette. In &quot;Syren&quot;, they spend time with their friends at the movies and pose as extras in Clara's video in &quot;Frightningale&quot;.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
Juleka dislikes Chloé and her rudeness towards everyone. Because Chloé prevents her from being in the class photo, Juleka falls into despair and cries, lamenting that she'll never be in a photo as long as Chloé finds a way to keep her out. Beyond that incident, Juleka is displeased with Chloé insulting Rose's notebook in &quot;The Notebook&quot;.

During her time as Reflekta, she makes it one of her first objectives to punish Chloé by insulting her looks and transforming her into one of her replicas.

== Trivia ==
* The name '''Juleka''' means &quot;beauty&quot;.
** Part of the '''Jule''' means &quot;Jewel&quot; in French,
*** In the Serbian dub, her name is changed to ''Julija''.
*** In Brazilian version, her name in some episodes is changed to '''Juleika'''.
* Juleka's surname '''Couffaine''' is a combination of &quot;couffin&quot; (French for &quot;coffin&quot;) and the French suffix &quot;-aine&quot; (meaning &quot;of or from a place&quot;), ultimately meaning &quot;of/from the coffin&quot;.
* '''Reflekta''' (Juleka's akumaztized villain name) may be a reference to the Reflekta camera.
* Juleka's earlier concept design was different in many ways, including her shorter purple hair, black and white-striped leggings, and dark purple boots.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Old Classroom Photo concept.png|Image]] from the [https://youtu.be/qpDCWD5G2jU 2014 Licensing Show Video].&lt;/ref&gt;
** She also owned a purple bass guitar with a pink strap.
* In [[Mr. Pigeon]], during the derby hat competition, Juleka and [[Rose Lavillant]] are standing next to a derby hat with gears attached to it, suggesting one of them or both made the hat.
* In &quot;The Evillustrator&quot; she sits next to Nathaniel in science class instead of sitting next to Rose as she usually does.
* In &quot;Copycat&quot; and &quot;Rogercop&quot;, Juleka is wearing white clothes instead of her usual dark gray clothes.
* In the [[It's Ladybug|theme song]], Juleka's face is blocked by [[Nino Lahiffe]]'s hand, foreshadowing the conflict in her episode &quot;Reflekta&quot;. 
* In &quot;Reflekta&quot;, Juleka and Rose reveal that they think that Juleka has a curse that prevents her from looking nice in photos. At the end of the episode, they believe it's been broken thanks to [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] and their classmates.
* Juleka negates Cat Noir's [[Cataclysm]] with her powers by transforming him into her image, making his Miraculous disappear and preventing him from touching anything with Cataclysm.
** In &quot;Reflekta,&quot; Juleka reveals that she hates cats.
** She owns and sometimes wears a glove on her right hand with a small mirror or makeup compact attached to it as seen in &quot;Reflekta&quot;.[[File:TSE (33).png|thumb|Juleka's partially obscured face in the theme song]]
* While Luka has blue tips at the end of his hair, Juleka has purple tips at the end of her hair.
* All the Couffaine's names so far end with &quot;-ka&quot;. 
** However, it is actually a pun, as a matter of fact in French it sounds like &quot;acouphène&quot; which means &quot;tinnitus&quot;.

== Personality ==
[[File:MP (311).png|left|thumb|Sabrina bringing a picture of Marinette's design to Chloé]]
Sabrina is a meek, mousy and very loyal girl to [[Chloé Bourgeois]], who always trying to impress Chloé and get on her good side by helping her. Despite being constantly bossed around and bullied by Chloé, she can be surprisingly unpleasant and be conniving herself, as shown by her stealing [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]]'s [[Marinette's derby hat|derby hat]] design for Chloé in &quot;[[Mr. Pigeon]]&quot; and eagerly helping Chloé get [[Alya Césaire]] suspended in &quot;[[Lady Wifi]]&quot;. Sabrina feels very guilty if she makes a mistake and has a warped sense of how friendship works, believing that she must completely submit herself to helping a friend, such as by doing their homework. This can be seen in &quot;[https://miraculousladybug.fandom.com/wiki/The_Evillustrator Evillustrator]&quot; when she temporarily commits to a stronger friendship with Marinette and offers to complete the whole group project herself. She also expresses joy at her liberation from Chloé's control, suggesting that she is actually unhappy in her situation. Sabrina seems to have a childish side to her as well, happily engaging in roleplaying games with Chloé and becoming distressed when the idea is rejected.

Outside of Chloé's presence and assistance, however, Sabrina is nice and grateful for anyone's geniality, compassion, and generosity. She has no problem giving praise when it's due seen in &quot;[https://miraculousladybug.fandom.com/wiki/Darkblade Darkblade]&quot;, after hearing Marinette's speech. In &quot;[https://miraculousladybug.fandom.com/wiki/Mayura_%28Heroes%27_Day_-_Part_2%29 Mayura]&quot; where she even cheered for Marinette as she admitted her feelings towards Adrien.

As Vanisher, she is malicious, confident, and vengeful. She messes with Chloé and humiliates her in any way possible.

As Miraculer, she wants to make Chloé continue wanting to play with her and has no qualms about stealing superpowers in order to make sure that happens. However, she is also childish as she constantly mimics Ladybug, as well as gullible when she easily falls for Rena Rouge's illusion.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Sabrina is a smart and hardworking girl as she is able to finish both her homework and Chloé's homework on time. She knows the rules of her school — noting that theft by a student results in one week of suspension — and can be very sneaky as she traps [[Juleka Couffaine]] in a bathroom stall with a chair without the adults' awareness in &quot;[[Reflekta]]&quot; and secretly taking a picture of [[Marinette's derby hat]] design in &quot;[[Mr. Pigeon]].&quot; 

=== As Vanisher ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Vanisher is entirely invisible who does not even cast a shadow and she is only partially visible if something covers her, such as glitter. Additionally, she is skilled in combat, holding up well against Ladybug and Cat Noir in a fight. She can also throw objects from her bag as projectiles, which are invisible as well.

=== As Miraculer ===
With her tonfa she can steal powers from others and use them for her own. She is able to use more than one power at once, such as combining a Lucky Charm weapon with Cataclysm. She also has the ability to grant others the superpowers she has stolen without losing them herself.

== Relationships ==

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:TB_Poor_Sabrina_5.jpeg|thumb|Chloé yelling at Sabrina.]]
Sabrina is dedicated to being Chloé's helper and friend, although she is always uneasy whenever she fails her in any way. Sabrina and Chloé have been friends since childhood, with Chloé offering Sabrina companionship in return for Sabrina doing her work for her. No matter how unfairly Chloé treats her, Sabrina does whatever she can to prove her usefulness, even going along with her heartless schemes, such as stealing [[Marinette's derby hat]] design or her [[Marinette's diary|diary]]. The two fight with each other in &quot;[[The Evillustrator]]&quot; when Marinette makes Sabrina realize that she's being used. However, at the end of the episode, she goes back to Chloé's side, saddened by the thought of her being attacked by [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg|Evillustrator]] and bribed with a beret. In &quot;Antibug&quot;, Chloé and Sabrina are seen cosplaying as Ladybug and Cat Noir. [[Butler Jean]] reveals that Chloé fights with Sabrina often, but that the worst time was when Sabrina accidentally revealed their identities to [[Jagged Stone]] and [[Nadja Chamack]], both of whom believed that Chloé was Ladybug. After this incident, Chloé starts pretending that Sabrina does not exist, distressing Sabrina and making her vulnerable to Hawk Moth's akumatization.

[[File:Antibug_(1280).png|thumb|left|Sabrina happily sits next to Chloé again.]]
In “[[Malediktator]]”, during the end Chloé's documentary Sabrina couldn't help but laugh despite trying to hide it, which resulted in her getting &quot;fired&quot;. Sabrina was devastated that she betrayed her best friend. Afterwards, Sabrina hugs Chloé during the latter’s welcome-back party. She’s then amazed by Chloé showing off her extremely dazzling phone case.

{{HideSpoiler|She believes that Chloé has changed in &quot;Stormy Weather 2&quot; calling her the best of best and even mentions playing Super Penguino with her in &quot;Oblivio&quot;.}}

As Vanisher, she does whatever she can to make Chloé's life miserable and to make sure that Chloé will never have any more friends. However, after she is defeated, she affectionately picks up the brooch that Chloé gave her, and at the end of the episode, the two make peace as Chloé stops ignoring Sabrina and gives her a new brooch.

As Miraculer, she desperately wants to continue being Chloé's friend and, after stealing Ladybug and Cat Noir's powers, asks her if she'd like Ladybug's so that they can play together.

=== [[Roger Raincomprix]] ===
[[File:Ladybug_Christmas_Special_(173).png|thumb|Sabrina is assured by her father.]]
Lieutenant Roger is Sabrina's father and she loves him immensely. When he becomes Rogercop, Sabrina quickly recognizes him, something that most civilians aren't usually able to do. She also joins him to find Adrien when it's believed that he has gone missing in &quot;[[Santa Claws]]&quot;.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:DB S01EP12 (1011).png|left|thumb|Sabrina relieved about Marinette freeing her hand from the trap box.]]
In general, Sabrina follows Chloé in making fun of and humiliating Marinette. However, as seen in &quot;The Evillustrator&quot;, Sabrina has a genuinely nice side and acts kinder towards Marinette throughout the episode after getting in a fight with Chloé, until she gets angry with her too because Marinette makes up an excuse to go fight the Evillustrator instead of doing the science project with her. Occasionally, Sabrina is kind to Marinette, expressing thanks to her for taking the trap box off her hand in &quot;Darkblade&quot; and being pleasantly surprised by the Christmas log from her at the [[Tom &amp; Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie|bakery]] in the Christmas special. In &quot;Mayura&quot;, while at a picnic she follows her classmates in praising Marinette for admitting her feelings to [[Adrien]].

[[File:1EFE6B67-A308-49D8-A151-1320C3627882.jpeg|thumb|Sabrina is happy to see Ladybug.]]
Treating Ladybug very differently from how she treats Marinette, Sabrina is joyous about Ladybug's heroic deeds and protection of Paris. In &quot;Catalyst&quot;, despite her at first not knowing it was an illusion she is devastated at the fact that Ladybug was akumatized and destroyed Cat Noir. When the real Ladybug deakumatizes her she is relieved that the heroine is still around. After Sabrina is informed it was one of Volpina's tricks wishing to repay her she decides to spread the truth about Ladybug giving people hope again.

As Vanisher, she proudly believes Ladybug can't defeat her, even after she gets covered in glitter.

As Miraculer, she constantly mimics Ladybug and has no qualms about stealing her superpowers.

=== [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien Agreste/Cat Noir]] ===
[[File:DC S01EP10 (48).png|thumb|left|Sabrina holding a poster that Adrien is signing for Chloé.]]
Though Sabrina doesn't appear to know Adrien very well, she supports Chloé's crush on him and her attempts to get closer to him, like Chloé's poster plan in &quot;[[Dark Cupid]]&quot;. Outside of her aiding Chloé's schemes, Sabrina likes Adrien and sees him as a friend, clearly showing her concern for him in the Christmas special when she goes driving with her father to find him and joins others to check on him once he is found.

Like with Ladybug, Sabrina considers Cat Noir important in keeping Paris safe from supervillains. In &quot;Heroes' Day - Part 1&quot;, despite her at first not knowing it was an illusion she was devastated at the fact that Cat Noir was destroyed by an akumatized Ladybug. After being deakumatized by the real one she was relieved the heroes were still around and on their side.

== Trivia ==
* In past class photos, Sabrina's hair was the same, but her clothes different; a dark green sweater with a light green diamond pattern with a light green headband, black leggings with green diamond patterns along with light green socks; green shoes and the same dark grey ribbon on her sweater.
* In earlier concept designs for Sabrina, she had full bangs with the rest of her hair worn up in a bun, her dress shirt's sleeves were shorter, and her sweater vest and sock pattern were shades of green.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Old Classroom Photo concept.png|Image]] from the [https://youtu.be/qpDCWD5G2jU 2014 Licensing Show Video].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Originally, Sabrina and Chloé were supposed to be in a trio with [[Alix Kubdel]], which was a reference to the main trio (Sam, Clover, and Alex) in ''Totally Spies!''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/674293643944067072&lt;/ref&gt;
* As with most of the characters in the show, Sabrina's last name is a wordplay in French. In this case, Raincomprix seems to be a turn on ''Rien Compris,'' meaning &quot;Not Understood&quot; or &quot;Misunderstood.&quot;
* Unlike other akumatized villains, Sabrina's first akumatization form, Vanisher does not appear to get a different outfit upon being infected, only becoming invisible.
* In &quot;[[Robostus]]&quot;, Sabrina's hair has dark green highlights.
** However, it is currently unknown whether this was intentional or an error.
* At Mangafest in Spain, [[Thomas Astruc]] said that Chloé and Sabrina's relationship would improve notably in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/ladybugspain/status/937213835852869632&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''',&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/755033027823046656&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''Nathan''' or '''Nath''', is a student in [[Miss Bustier's class]] at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]]. In &quot;[[The Evillustrator]]&quot;, when [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]] mocks his art and his crush on [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]], he is infected with an [[akuma]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and becomes the '''Evillustrator''', an artistic [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]] whose drawings become real.

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Nathaniel is fairly short with turquoise eyes and messy red orange hair. He has long bangs that are brushed to the left side of his face.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a red t-shirt with a black design on the front. Over his shirt, he wears a gray dress jacket with a folded collar, folded sleeves, and side pockets. He wears purple jeans that are rolled up at the bottom, and his shoes are gray with white lace and a white section where his toes would be.

=== As the Evillustrator ===
The Evillustrator's skin is light purple, and his hair is brushed back while colored orange with purple tips. On his head he has a dark purple beret, and on his face, he has a dark purple butterfly-shaped mask. 

He wears a white suit with dark purple stripes and solid dark purple legs that become red halfway down his lower legs. On his chest, there is a black circle with smaller red, yellow, and blue circles inside. His collar is swan-necked, with a red collar underneath.

{{For2|more of Nathaniel's outfits and designs|Nathaniel Kurtzberg/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:EV S01EP08 (49).png|left|thumb|Nathaniel being brought back from his focus on his drawings by Ms. Mendeleiev.]]

=== As Nathaniel ===
Nathaniel is imaginative and artistic. An introverted soul, he is quiet and shy in class, and seems to be quite easily lost in his fantasies, such as when he is daydreaming about his crush, Marinette. In his drawings, he creates &quot;Super Nathan&quot;, a courageous superhero version of himself, as a way to imagine himself as being more brash and outgoing. Nathaniel can be rather observant about details around him, including goo left by [[Mylène Haprèle|Horrificator]] in the [[Horrificator|episode of the same name]] and the details of Chloé's [[Chloé's bracelet|bracelet]] in &quot;[[Rogercop]]&quot;. Afraid of being judged, he prefers to be secretive about his art, and if he is accused of something, he becomes nervous, and, if the accusations are true, deeply embarrassed. He is easily terrified in some scary or stressful situations, as in &quot;Horrificator&quot;, but in other situations, he is willing to stand up for himself, such as when others accuse him of stealing Chloé's bracelet.

In &quot;[[Reverser]]&quot;, Nathaniel has a bit of a habit of jumping to conclusions when he assumed the book Marinette gave him came from Ladybug, when it actually came from Marc, without giving him the chance to explain. Similar to Cat Noir he is sensitive of his feelings towards the heroine.

=== As Evillustrator ===
Evillustrator ( &quot;who is based on &quot;Super Nathan&quot; ) is more confident and direct, such as when he literally barged into Marinette's bedroom and asked her out to celebrate his birthday with him. Even when akumatized, he still genuinely cares for her, promising her that he would stop attacking Chloé and even defying [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] for a while when his date was at stake. However, he is furious when humiliated or tricked and he can be short-tempered and reckless - his response to Marinette betraying him was accusing her of being just like Chloé.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Nathaniel is an artist, skilled in drawing pictures with pencil, pen, and marker, and creating digital arts on his tablet. He is good at drawing still life, such as Chloé's bracelet, and drawing comics with human figures and costume designs. In &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot;, Nathaniel is also shown to be talented in painting, as he made a one for [[Caline Bustier]] for her birthday.

In his [[The Evillustrator|titular episode]], Nathaniel as Evillustrator is shown &quot;drawing&quot; musical notes to create a melody, suggesting he has some musical knowledge or talent as well.

=== As the Evillustrator ===
&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; widths=&quot;240&quot; crop=&quot;true&quot;&gt;

EV S01EP08 (523).png|The Evillustrator's tablet not working in darkness.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Evillustrator has the power to draw whatever he wants onto his drawing tablet to make it appear and exist in real life. The objects he creates can levitate and move freely in the air. He can also erase objects, both real-life objects or previous drawings, such as erasing a hole into a wall. However, in order to draw, the Evillustrator needs light, so in darkness, he is unable to use his powers.

Additionally, the Evillustrator is supernaturally agile, being able to leap high and far distances.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:EV_S01EP08_(903).png|thumb|Comic book cover of Ladybug drawn by Nathaniel.]]Nathaniel had a secret crush on Marinette, drawing comics in his sketchbook of him saving her from villains. When he becomes the Evillustrator, he has the confidence to act on his feelings, asking Marinette if she would go out on a date with him for his birthday. When Marinette betrays him by leading Cat Noir to him, it hurts him deeply, and he angrily announces she is just like Chloé. It is not explicitly stated, but rather implied by the crossed-out image of his comic featuring Marinette, that by the end of the episode, Nathaniel no longer has romantic feelings for her. Outside of &quot;The Evillustrator&quot;, Nathaniel treats Marinette politely and respectfully, such as asking her about her campaign in &quot;Darkblade&quot;. However, he does not appreciate it when she points him out as a suspect for stealing Chloé's bracelet without stronger evidence in &quot;Rogercop&quot;. In &quot;Befana&quot;, Nathaniel works with his friends to protect Marinette from [[Gina Dupain|Befana]].

In &quot;[[Reverser]]&quot;, Nathaniel becomes upset with Marinette when he mistakenly thought she was using Marc to tease him but after everything was cleared up he still continues his friendship with her and dedicates his first comic to her.

Nathaniel is relieved to know that Ladybug is around to save the day. After his time as the Evillustrator, in his sketchbook, he has drawn a comic book cover that features Ladybug with hearts drawn in red at the bottom of the page, possibly implying he now has romantic feelings for her.&lt;ref&gt;https://mobile.twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/687786358782451712&lt;/ref&gt; Which is confirmed in &quot;Reverser&quot;, when commented by Chloé that Ladybug is all he draws and when he assumed the &quot;Diary of Ladybug&quot; was written by the actual Ladybug.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:EV S01EP08 (68).png|left|thumb|Chloé looking at Nathaniel's sketchbook and revealing his crush on Marinette.]]
Like most people, Nathaniel dislikes Chloé for being a self-absorbed, mean-spirited person. He is horrified when she grabs his sketchbook from the floor, and, seeing his drawing of himself and Marinette, reveals his crush on her to the entire class. He also doesn't like how Chloé bothers Marinette; so as Evillustrator, he draws a giant hairdryer to blow her away. At first promising Marinette that he wouldn't attack Chloé again, he changes his mind after Marinette breaks his heart, and goes to destroy Chloé after all.

=== [[Alix Kubdel]] ===
Alix appears to be close friends with Nathaniel. He approaches her for comfort and advice in &quot;Reverser&quot;.

=== [[Marc Anciel]] ===
While initially angry, believing he tricked him, after the misunderstanding was cleared, they began a project together using Marc's stories and Nathaniel's art skills to create a comic book, forming a friendship at the same time. They continue working together on comic books as seen in &quot;Frozer&quot; and &quot;Mayura&quot;. 

Later on, in one moment when scoping couples in the school, Nathaniel and Marc are spotted in one of the shots.

* Nathaniel's name is an homage to [[Nathanaël Bronn]], the chief art director of the show.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/665260957023797249&lt;/ref&gt;
** A ''Miraculous'' promotional French document from TF1PRO released on September 23, 2015 spelled his name as Nathanaël, but [[Thomas Astruc]] later confirmed the correct spelling of his name to be Nathaniel when he released multiple characters' full names on July 18, 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://miraculeusecoccinelle.tumblr.com/post/129733355946/miraculous-les-aventures-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

** Nathaniel is Jewish, as supported by Thomas Astruc, as Jack Kirby was also Jewish.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* In the French dub of the show, the Evillustrator's name is Le Dessinateur, meaning &quot;the illustrator,&quot; &quot;the cartoonist,&quot; or &quot;the designer.&quot;
* The Evillustrator tries to avoid following Hawk Moth's orders to get the [[Miraculouses]]. As punishment, Hawk Moth briefly controls his body and almost prevents him from preparing for his date with Marinette.
** This is one of two times Hawk Moth has used this ability, the other time being in &quot;[[Pixelator]]&quot;.
[[File:TPT (922).png|thumb|Nathaniel transforming back into the Evillustrator because of Puppeteer.]]
* Nathaniel seems to be ambidextrous to some extent:
** When he wakes up at the beginning of &quot;The Evillustrator&quot;, he is holding a pencil with his right hand and can be using his right hand in the background of many episodes and other media artworks.
** He is left-handed when he's the Evillustrator, as his drawing pad is on his right arm and he draws with his left hand.
** In &quot;[[Robostus]]&quot;, Nathaniel is notably shown drawing a sketch of [[Markov]] with his left hand. 
* Nathaniel is bisexual, along with [[Marc Anciel]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/miraculousmx/status/1021502157219160064&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/1050926882395381760&lt;/ref&gt;
* His shirt symbol is based on the French rock band Magma. Both Thomas Astruc and Nathanaël Bronn are fans of the band.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/827678785696854016&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nathaniel sits behind [[Ivan Bruel|Ivan]] in class to draw without being noticed.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/698919834260783104&lt;/ref&gt;
** He and Ivan are the only students in the class to not share their desks with another student.
* As of &quot;Chameleon,&quot; this is no longer true as [[Lila Rossi]] sits beside Nathaniel.
* Nathaniel becomes the Evillustrator a second time when the [[Manon Chamack|Puppeteer]] transforms him using a [[Marinette's dolls|doll]] in the episode &quot;The Puppeteer&quot; and once again in &quot;Gamer 2.0&quot;.
* Nathaniel's drawing of Ladybug is actually an edited version of the issue #10 cover of [[The Mini Menace Ladybug|''The Mini Menace Ladybug'']], a series of fake comic covers drawn by Thomas Astruc. 
* Since Nathaniel is Jewish and he is about 13-15 years old, he must have already done his Bar Mitzvah.
* In &quot;Reverser&quot;, Nathaniel is a part of the school's Art Club along with Juleka, Rose, Alix and Marinette.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a student in [[Miss Bustier's class]] at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://miraculeusecoccinelle.tumblr.com/post/129733355946/miraculous-les-aventures-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[Horrificator]]&quot;, after feeling humiliated for getting scared easily while filming [[Nino Lahiffe]]'s movie, she gets [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and becomes '''Horrificator''', a monster [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Mylène is short and chubby with blonde hair that has some strands dyed green, blue, and magenta which is styled in dreadlocks with a dreadlock on her left side of her head has a purple cat bead, another dreadlock on her left side has a golden loop and golden brown eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
She wears a pink bandanna to hold her hair back, and she has a necklace with a stone pendant. She wears a periwinkle shirt with a white silhouette design on the front of a bird holding a branch with leaves, which is underneath an olive green hoodie jacket. There are pins attached to her jacket: on the right side, she has a daisy pin; on the left side, she has a ladybug pin, a panda pin, and a yellow and green pin. Additionally, she wears dark gray jean shorts, black leggings, and dark purple and white sneakers.

=== As Horrificator ===
Horrificator is a large salamander-like monster, the top half of her body mainly pink and the bottom half, along with her forearms, mainly purple. She has three yellow eyes with red pupils, the third eye being in the middle of her forehead, and periwinkle tentacles with spots are on the back of her head. Her head has freckles; her mouth has sharp, jagged white teeth, and her tongue is light blue. She has dark purple claws on her hands, while the claws her her feet are brown, the toes being tan-colored. Also, she has a long purple tail. The [[List of akumatized objects|pin]] that [[Ivan Bruel|Ivan]] gave her is attached next to one of her head tentacles but is hidden by her pink goo.

{{For2|more of Mylène's outfits and designs|Mylène Haprèle/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:HF S01EP11 (109).png|left|thumb|Myléne grateful for the pin from Ivan.]]
Mylène is a meek and cordial girl. Although she tries to be brave, she is easily frightened by anything that she sees as scary, which she is ashamed of and even cries about in &quot;Horrificator&quot;. She also is sensitive to being made fun of, hurt by Chloé's mean remarks about her. She appreciates kindness, and she speaks very fondly of those she loves. According to [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] in her webisode, Mylène always try to look for the best in people.

As Horrificator, she relishes in making everyone scared (as opposed to her being scared). Aggressive and menacing, she attacks everyone and doesn't like it if any of them aren't freaked out by her. Despite this, she retains her feelings towards [[Ivan]] and refuses to harm him. When she is calmed down and tiny, her bravado and confidence are gone, leaving her terrified by the others and running into Ivan's arm for comfort and protection.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;Mylène is a decent actress, being chosen for the leading role in the class' film. However, it's hard for her to stay in character when she is scared by something, like Ivan's mask.

=== As Horrificator ===
Horrificator can spit a very resistant purple goo that she uses to block exits and trap people. Whenever she catches people, she brings them to her lair and traps them inside hardened cocoons. Whenever people scream in fear upon seeing her, she grows larger, but if they aren't scared, stay calm or calm down, she shrinks and eventually becomes as small as a house cat. The larger she is, the stronger she gets and she can make use of her tail by grabbing people with it.

== Family ==
{{Haprèle Tree}}

== Relationships ==
=== [[Ivan Bruel]] ===
[[File:OR-2 (903).png|thumb|Myléne telling Ivan that she loves the lyrics he wrote for her.]] Mylène has romantic feelings for Ivan. Once she got to know him, she isn't terrified by his appearance, and they treat each other very sweetly.

In &quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)|Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]&quot; and &quot;[[Stoneheart (Origins - Part 2)|Stoneheart]]&quot;, she is the cause of both Ivan's akumatizations: in the first part, Ivan gets akumatized when he is teased by Kim because he doesn't have the courage to confess to her, while in the second part he is akumatized because she runs away from him, scared by his loud rock serenade. After transforming for the second time, Ivan kidnaps her and climbs the [[Eiffel Tower]] holding her in his fist, much to her frustration and fear. He has then defeated thanks to [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] tying them together with her [[yo-yo]] to make them kiss as a distraction. After transforming back, Ladybug gives Mylène the lyrics to Ivan's serenade; she is so touched by them that she hugs him, making him blush profusely.

[[File:DB S01EP12 (697).png|left|thumb|Ivan comforting Mylène as they worry about Darkblade.]] 
In &quot;Horrificator&quot;, she appreciates Ivan's attempt to console her after she was insulted by Chloé, but she ends up crying and running away to the bathroom anyway. Once akumatized, she doesn't attack Ivan, licking his face instead. After shrinking thanks to her calming song &quot;[[Smelly Wolf]]&quot;, she runs into Ivan's arms and, after transforming back, they kiss. In &quot;[[Darkblade]]&quot;, when she and her [[Miss Bustier's classroom|classmates]] are in the [[Hôtel de Ville]] under siege by [[Armand D'Argencourt|Darkblade]] and his knights, she gets close to Ivan, and he hugs her to comfort her. They dance together at Chloé's party in &quot;[[Despair Bear]]&quot;. He also comforts her again in &quot;[[Captain Hardrock]]&quot; when [[Anarka Couffaine|Anarka]] is akumatized. 

=== [[Fred Haprèle]] ===
[[File:The Mime 141.png|thumb|Mylène expresses pride in her father's work.]] Mylène loves her father as she is proud of his acting abilities. She is touched when he reveals that he keeps a photo of her inside the pouch of his hat as a good luck charm.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
Mylène gets along well with Marinette and enjoys hanging out with her. As of &quot;[[Despair Bear]]&quot;, Mylène has become part of Marinette's close circle of friends, along with [[Alya Césaire]], [[Alix Kubdel]], [[Rose Lavillant]], and [[Juleka Couffaine]]. She is well aware of Marinette's crush on Adrien, and supports her efforts in trying to attract his attention, such as in &quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot;, &quot;[[Glaciator]]&quot; and &quot;[[Gorizilla]]&quot;. In &quot;Glaciator&quot;, when she and Ivan go to [[André Glacier|André's]] to get ice cream with Alya, Nino and Marinette, Mylène is shown feeling sorry for Marinette after Adrien is unable to attend, leaving her heartbroken. In &quot;[[Frightningale]]&quot;, Mylène shared in a group hug with Marinette when she turned down the offer to play Ladybug in Clara's video to be with her friends yet cheers her on when she changes her mind later on and takes the role. 

[[File:GT_(48).png|thumb|left|Mylène agrees to help Marinette, citing that she is always there for her friends.]]As with Ladybug like her friends, Mylène admires the heroine's dedication to keep Paris safe. In &quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot;, she and her friends were willing to distract Gigantitan to prevent him from harming Ladybug.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:Miraculous_Season_2_Sneak_Peak_(126).png|thumb|Mylène is shocked when Chloé insults her sweater.]] Just as the rest of her class, Mylène is weary of Chloé and her rude insults. In &quot;Horrificator&quot;, Mylène runs off in tears after Chloé mocks her for being a scaredy-cat, but she gets her chance to get payback later as Horrificator when she traps Chloé as one of her victims. She also tells [[Ms. Mendeleiev]] in &quot;[[Antibug]]&quot; that she isn't the one pulling Chloé's hair, which Chloé confirms. Even though she isn't particularly fond of her, Mylène willingly attends Chloé's party in &quot;Despair Bear&quot;.

== Trivia ==
* In the Serbian dub, her name is changed to Milena.
* As seen in &quot;Stoneheart (Origins - Part 2)&quot;, she is scared of heights.
* Whenever she needs to feel better, she sings &quot;Smelly Wolf&quot; to herself. Ladybug uses the song to stop Horrificator by singing it to her with Cat Noir and their remaining classmates.
* Her akumatization appears to be heavily influenced by the movie the class makes in &quot;Horrificator&quot;.
** Since her akumatized form is named after the movie's monster, this makes Mylène one of the villains that Hawk Moth technically doesn't name.
* Along with the Mime, Horrificator is one of the two akumatized supervillains without a speaking role in Season 1.
** Her akumatized form looks similar to the mask Ivan is wearing for the film.
*In her webisode, [[Mylène (webisode)|Mylène]], it is revealed that she is interested in politics and would like to make Paris a better place for its inhabitants.
* Scarlet Horrificator reappears in the two-part special event &quot;[[Heroes' Day]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfou&quot;&gt;https://pandasuite.com/viewer/2.0.2/59a6c26e48abe6f53a002dc9?t=1 (direct video source [https://data.pandasuite.com/videos/59a3e7def643f27d7300131b-universal_1024_1024_20_main_3-0.mp4 here] and English subtitles [http://miraculousubs.tumblr.com/post/164947363272/the-careless-whisper-scene-at-the-end-really here])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a student in [[Miss Bustier's class]] at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]]. In &quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)]]&quot;, after [[Lê Chiến Kim|Kim]] teases him for not having the guts to ask [[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]] out, he gets [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and becomes '''Stoneheart''', a rock golem [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]]. Because Ladybug doesn't purify the akuma after defeating him the first time, he gets akumatized once again in &quot;[[Stoneheart (Origins - Part 2)]]&quot; when Mylène runs away from him because of his loud serenade.

{{For2|more of Ivan's outfits and designs|Ivan Bruel/Designs}}

== Personality ==

[[File:HF S01EP11 (38).png|left|thumb|Ivan guaranteeing to Mylène that the mask isn't something to be scared of.]]
Ivan is a tough guy with a tender heart.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://miraculeusecoccinelle.tumblr.com/post/129733355946/miraculous-les-aventures-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir&lt;/ref&gt; He often appears grouchy and stubborn, particularly around situations he isn't interested in, like while being held captive at the [[Nino Lahiffe|Bubbler]]'s party in &quot;[[The Bubbler]]&quot;, but he also can sometimes be openly enthusiastic and expressive, cheering for [[Alix Kubdel|Alix]] to beat [[Lê Chiến Kim|Kim]] in &quot;[[Timebreaker]]&quot;. The only person so far that he has shown a lot of warmth towards is Mylène.

Although, he is willing to help others in dangerous or bad situations, like when he fought off [[Caline Bustier|Zombizou]]'s zombies so that the rest could escape.

He gets angry when he or his friends are unfairly treated or teased, sometimes standing up towards the culprit—even occasionally willing to physically fight back—and other times quietly moping about it. On the other hand, when people are kind and patient with him, he is able to open up about his inner feelings and listen to their advice.

As Stoneheart, he is extremely aggressive and furious, his enemies, including Kim and Chloé, being the ones he is the most furious at. He still loves Mylène, but his reasoning has been clouded when it comes to her and he believes that Hawk Moth will bring the two to be together forever.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Ivan is able to write down and create song lyrics, but his singing is loud and terrifying.

=== As Stoneheart ===
&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; widths=&quot;250&quot; crop=&quot;true&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Stoneheart is a golem endowed with superhuman strength. He has a strong grip with his hands, being able to securely hold human victims or the wad of paper that is the [[List of akumatized objects|akumatized object]]. Although not very fast when running, he still has fast enough reflexes to grab things in mid-air, and can throw things, like a human or vehicle, with a lot of power. Additionally, when he gets hit with an attack, he grows in size and his strength increases.

Due to Ladybug not purifying the akuma, the akuma multiplies and transforms civilians into frozen versions of Stoneheart. When Ivan becomes Stoneheart again, the copies of Stoneheart begin to move, and they are under the original Stoneheart's control.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Mylène Haprèle]] ===
[[File:OR-2 (910).png|left|thumb|Mylène hugging Ivan.]]
Ivan has romantic feelings for Mylène and cares about her deeply. He comforts her when she is scared or sad and he treats her very gently and considerately. His crush on Mylène is an indirect cause of his akumatization in &quot;Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir&quot;, and in &quot;Stoneheart&quot; he gets akumatized again because Mylène runs off after being scared by his loud serenade. Once he transforms the second time, he kidnaps Mylène so they can always be together. Ladybug also uses his crush to her advantage: by making Stoneheart accidentally kiss Mylène by tying them with her [[yo-yo]], she makes him drop his akumatized object. After Mylène gets to read his song and explains she couldn't understand it while he was shouting, Ivan apologizes and vows to sing softer. In response, she hugs him, to his surprise, causing him to blush.

[[File:HF S01EP11 (958).png|thumb|Ivan and Mylène kissing.]]
When she is upset for being easily scared in &quot;[[Horrificator]]&quot;, Ivan tries to cheer her up and gives her a pin. They also share a kiss after Myléne is no longer akumatized. In &quot;[[Darkblade]]&quot;, he continues to be compassionate with her, hugging her to comfort her when [[Armand D'Argencourt|Darkblade]] and his knights are closing in outside the [[Hôtel de Ville]]. In &quot;[[Glaciator]]&quot;, Ivan shares an ice cream cone with Mylène at André's ice cream stand, also mentioning that they had gone there before as a couple.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:OR-2 (212).png|left|thumb|Marinette giving encouraging advice to Ivan.]]
Ivan is friends with Marinette, and according to Marinette in &quot;[[My Birthday Party]]&quot;, he always treats her nicely. They both agree that Chloé is terrible, and Ivan can be seen grinning at Marinette after stands up against Chloé at the end of &quot;Stoneheart&quot;. He also listens to her suggestions, deciding to write a song for Mylène and try to remain positive about his situation with her. In &quot;Darkblade&quot;, Ivan is happy when Marinette runs for class representative. He shows concern for Marinette when she becomes disappointed about Adrien not coming trying to comfort with the others in &quot;Glaciator&quot;. Not being aware of Marinette's crush like Mylène and others, he is curious about who has green eyes that Marinette has feelings for.

When it comes to Ladybug, Ivan is glad that there is a hero watching over Paris. He is able to reveal his romantic feelings for Mylène thanks to Ladybug's help in &quot;Stoneheart&quot;.

=== [[Alix Kubdel]] ===
Ivan and Alix appear to be good friends. In &quot;[[Mr. Pigeon]]&quot;, they're seen talking to each other, he cheers for her at the race with Kim in &quot;[[Timebreaker]]&quot;, and in &quot;[[Pixelator]]&quot;, the two have a pillow fight while getting work experience in [[Le Grand Paris]].

=== [[Lê Chiến Kim]] ===

In &quot;Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir&quot;, when Kim sends him a teasing note in class about him not having the courage to ask Mylène out, he gets angry and tries to beat him. Later, once he is akumatized, Stoneheart goes after Kim in revenge, but after being de-evilized, he apologizes to Kim the next day in &quot;Stoneheart&quot;, noting he wasn't himself.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:HF_S01EP11_(136).png|thumb|left|Ivan gets angry when Chloé hurts Mylène’s feelings.]]
Ivan despises Chloé and the way she treats others. In &quot;Stoneheart&quot;, Chloé calls him a monster because of his akumatization the previous day. It almost makes him angry enough to be akumatized again, but Marinette manages to calm him down. When he does get akumatized again, though, he kidnaps Chloé, along with Mylène, and eventually throws her from the [[Eiffel Tower]], where she gets saved by Ladybug. Ivan is also infuriated by Chloé when she hurts Mylène's feelings in &quot;Horrificator&quot;, informing her she is lame in response to her calling Mylène lame.

{{For2|more of Tom’s outfits and designs|Tom Dupain/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:OR1-(174).png|left|thumb|Tom and Sabine watching Marinette leave for school.]]
Tom is passionate about his job and loves to share with his daughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://miraculeusecoccinelle.tumblr.com/post/129733355946/miraculous-les-aventures-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir&lt;/ref&gt; He also likes to play video games with Marinette and seems to be quite confident in his abilities as a gamer, saying his daughter learned from the best. He is protective of his loved ones, even courageously going against [[André Bourgeois|the mayor]]'s authority when [[Chloé Bourgeois]] tries to convince [[Roger Raincomprix]] arrest Marinette in &quot;[[Rogercop]]&quot;. In this same episode, he tells Marinette that passing the blame onto others is wrong, showing that he does not approve of selfish behavior. As a well-meaning parent, Tom will discipline his daughter or call her out on disobedient and troubled behavior. He also gets exasperated, frustrated, and disappointed in some cases, but he usually means well and doesn't hold a grudge afterward. While he can be intrusive sometimes, usually related to Marinette's crushes, he knows his boundaries. Caring about the well-being of others, Tom assists and comforts anyone, whether he is familiar with them or not, and he is very friendly and optimistic.

In &quot;Troublemaker&quot;, he is somewhat nervous in front of the camera, very protective when his family's privacy gets invaded. Tom has proven himself to be very brave on occasion seen in &quot;Mayura&quot;, when he took part in the Paris Rebellion.

When he was willing to defend the bakery and their home from Gigantitan. But according to Sabine, Tom has a habit of jumping to conclusions or making a big deal out of everything when he quickly assumed that Marinette was in love with Cat Noir or when things don't go well. As Weredad, he is overprotective and will become antagonistic when he assumes that someone is going harm or threaten his daughter.

== Abilities ==
=== As Tom Dupain ===
A baker, Tom can make multiple delicious foods like pastries and candies. He also knows how to play video games, which is a hobby he enjoys outside of work.

He is really strong as he is able to pick up a three layer cake seen in &quot;Befana&quot; or his wife and Marinette with ease.

=== As Weredad ===
His strength increases and can attack with thorny vines that comes from his hand while the main one was used as a trap to prevent anyone from reaching the akumatized object and its prisoner.

== Family ==
{{Dupain-Cheng Tree}}

== Relationships ==
=== [[Sabine Cheng]] ===
[[File:SS (1631).png|thumb|Tom being embraced by Sabine.]]
Sabine and Tom have been married for twenty years. A loving couple, they often show each other affection and support. They make a strong, successful team together running their bakery business, and they give each other consolation when they're dealing with or witnessing problematic situations. When they are getting ready for their anniversary in &quot;[[Timebreaker]]&quot;, he stresses about how he looks, and the couple hugs each other after the [[Nino Lahiffe|Bubbler]]'s defeat in the [[The Bubbler|episode of the same name]].

Tom gets really excited about Marinette &quot;loving&quot; Cat Noir he doesn't listen to Sabine when she wasn't completely sure about Cat Noir's feelings. Tom is comforted by her when the breakfast date doesn't end well and after he is deakumatized the two embrace each other.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:RC_S01EP09_(5).png|thumb|left|Tom going to school with Marinette for Career Day.]]
Tom loves his daughter and supports her, desiring the best for her in all aspects of life. They enjoy playing video games together, and he often praises her skills, very proud of her for getting to design [[Jagged Stone]]'s next [[Rock Giant|album]] cover in &quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot;. Also, Tom promises to protect her when she is distressed, even standing up for her against the mayor of [[Paris]] when he impulsively accuses her of theft. However, Tom will be stern and straightforward with her when she is acting poorly or disobedient, punishing her at the most. He points out to Marinette that she is guilty of making the situation with [[Chloé Bourgeois]]'s [[Chloé's bracelet|bracelet]] worse by accusing others and not letting the adults figure it out in &quot;Rogercop&quot;. In &quot;[[Simon Says]]&quot;, Tom and Sabine put Marinette under curfew because she is often absent from [[Collège Françoise Dupont|school]]. After her attendance improves, they lift the curfew, though when she mysteriously leaves them for something, he admits he doesn't understand her sometimes. Having a great father-daughter relationship with her, Tom enjoys teasing and goofing off for Marinette, and he is  happy to have her as his daughter.

He is extremely proud of Marinette in &quot;Queen Wasp&quot;, when she gets the opportunity to go to New York supporting whether or not if she accepts the offer. But likes the idea of opening their bakery in America.

In &quot;Weredad&quot;, he shows great concern for Marinette when Ladybug's Lucky Charm ends up crashing into her room and yet was worried when she couldn't be found. Upon finding her he was ecstatic when Marinette was in love with Cat Noir and does everything to make the date go well. However, during the date when the hero mentions being in love with Ladybug he becomes heartbroken seeing his daughter devastated. After his deakumatization and Marinette accepting the hero's love of Ladybug he was happy that the two were alright being friends. 

As Weredad, Tom uses his powers to protect to Marinette from a world of heartbreak.

[[File:AM-(525).png|thumb|Tom and Sabine watching Ladybug, Cat Noir, and Kim.]]
Tom, being a major fan and supporter of Ladybug, is grateful for her, believing that she and Cat Noir will keep Paris protected. Tom is unaware of Marinette's double life as Ladybug, as he meets the heroine in &quot;[[Animan]]&quot; without recognizing her as his daughter. Still enthusiastic about and supportive to the superhero, Tom openly helps her in any way he can, allowing them to hide in the bakery as they wait for [[Otis Césaire|Animan]] to find them. Tom pumps his fist in excitement when Ladybug destroys [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]]'s akuma-made projection in &quot;[[Stoneheart (Origins - Part 2)|Stoneheart]]&quot;, and in &quot;[[Lady Wifi]]&quot;, Tom and Sabine watch worriedly when [[Alya Césaire|Lady Wifi]] threatens to expose Ladybug's real identity. When Marinette is doubtful of Ladybug in &quot;Stoneheart&quot;, Tom reassures her to trust that Ladybug and Cat Noir are going to protect them, helping them by not being afraid. As well as and in &quot;Mayura&quot;. when he took part in the Paris Rebellion.

=== [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien Agreste/Cat Noir]] ===
[[File:TG (273).png|left|thumb|Tom talking to Adrien and doing his signature video game pose.]]
Tom is well aware of Marinette's feelings for him, constantly watching them in Marinette's room while they're practicing for the ''[[Ultimate Mecha Strike III]]'' tournament with the excuse of bringing up pastries. He tries to impress Adrien by saying how Marinette learned video games from the best, referring to himself. Once Tom and Sabine learn that Adrien has gone missing in &quot;[[Santa Claws]]&quot;, they go out and help search for him. They also go to check on him at the [[Agreste mansion]] after they find out that he isn't missing anymore. In &quot;Befana&quot;, Tom along with his wife and mother admire the moment Adrien and Marinette as he gives her his gift.

Like with Ladybug, Tom appreciates Cat Noir's heroism, happy to have him around to save Paris from villains. He meets Cat Noir in &quot;Animan&quot;, unaware that he is Adrien but willing to help him anyway he can by hiding Kim, and in &quot;Mayura&quot; when he took part in the Paris Rebellion.

In &quot;Weredad&quot;, upon finding his daughter with Cat Noir, he was ecstatic when Marinette was in &quot;love&quot; with him and invites the hero to a breakfast date. However, during the date when the hero mentions being in love with Ladybug, he becomes heartbroken seeing his daughter devastated which leads to his akumatization. But when Tom is deakumatized and the misunderstanding is cleared up leading to Marinette and Cat Noir being friends afterwards he forgives the hero. Tom offers him the chance to work at their bakery to help him win Ladybug's love and knows that he is as brave and courageous as the best bakers.

As Weredad, Tom becomes very angry at Cat Noir for breaking Marinette's heart and finds him unworthy of his daughter's love.

=== [[André Bourgeois]] ===
Tom usually respects André and other officials, but he gets angry at André when he jumps to conclusions about Marinette stealing his daughter's bracelet. However, in &quot;Santa Claws&quot;, he treats the mayor kindly as André drops by to get pastries.

== Trivia ==
* Tom is named after creator [[Thomas Astruc]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/664891957135728644&lt;/ref&gt;
* His last name, Dupain, comes from the French words &quot;du pain&quot; that mean &quot;of the bread&quot; or &quot;some bread.&quot;
* While it's unknown if Tom Dupain was Marinette's father's name at the beginning, Marinette calls out to him, saying &quot;father&quot; in Chinese (父), on the second fake cover of ''The Mini Menace Ladybug''.
** He is also most likely the person lying on the floor and holding the ladybug-themed necklace.
* In &quot;Rogercop&quot;, he states that he wakes up at 4 A.M. every morning because of his work.
* As displayed by [[Marinette's cellphone|Marinette's phone]] in &quot;Timebreaker&quot;, Tom's number is +33602423.
* Marinette reveals that Tom likes giving Marinette's class baking lessons, like in &quot;[[Despair Bear]]&quot;.
* While baking, he wears a white shirt instead of his regular blue one.
* In &quot;Sandboy&quot;, Tom's greatest fear is dough coming to life to eat him.
* In &quot;[[Weredad]]&quot;, Tom is the the fourth akumatized character to be related to Marinette after [[Gina Dupain]] in &quot;[[Befana]]&quot; [[Rolland Dupain]] in &quot;[[Bakerix]]&quot; and [[Wang Cheng]] in &quot;[[Kung Food]]&quot;.
** When akumatized he resembles the [[w:c:disney:Beast|Beast]] due to the fact that his akumatized object is a rose.
* According to the timeline his and Sabine's wedding anniversary dates in April of 2015 meaning that they were married in 1995. Also meaning that Tom possibly proposed to Sabine when he was 20. Meaning that for Marinette to be born in 2001 he would've been at least 26.
** Then counting backwards another 20 years from 1995 it means that Tom was born in 1975 which is the year of the Rabbit.
* According to Marinette's instagram page, her father used to have two left feet and she calls him and her mother a &quot;one true pair&quot;.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' was a character from the old, unused concept of [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Félix Agreste|Cat Noir]] being in a team of superheroes called the [[Quantic Kids]]. He is seen with [[Melodie]] and [[Sparrow]], the other members of the team. However, the concept was discarded, and so Mercury never appeared outside concept art.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/648969656166952961&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, it is unknown if he exists in the [[Quantic Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoXav4p8zJ4&amp;lc=z124w3x4lnyvxzdrw04chzywfoqvjxsqohw&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==

=== As Mercury ===
As a superhero, Mercury had dark blue/purple skin with white lightning bolt-like markings on where his eyebrows would be and on top of his head. In [[Thomas Astruc]]'s early designs for him, his body had lightning bolt-like lines with light blue edges all over his body, meeting up and through dots on the back of his hands, shoulders, elbows, torso, and knees. His feet appeared to have had white shoe soles.

== Abilities ==

=== As Mercury ===
In concept art, it appears that Mercury had super speed.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/648580045406109696&lt;/ref&gt; was an old, unused concept of [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[ Félix Agreste|Cat Noir]] (Félix) being members of a superhero team, as requested by a producer. It failed to help sell the concept of Ladybug to broadcasters, which resulted in Ladybug and Cat Noir remaining as a duo.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoXav4p8zJ4&amp;lc=z124w3x4lnyvxzdrw04chzywfoqvjxsqohw&lt;/ref&gt;

Sparrow exists in the [[Quantic Universe]] with Ladybug and Cat Noir, as seen in &quot;[[The Dark Owl]]&quot; and the comic book series [[Miraculous Adventures|''Miraculous Adventures'']]. However, the fate of the other characters that made up the rest of the team is unknown. They may still exist in the [[Quantic Universe]], but they may have been discarded in the same manner as Félix, with some of their attributes being incorporated into other characters.

* [[Félix Agreste|Félix Agreste/Cat Noir]] — a teenage boy with the secret identity of a black cat-themed superhero. He has the power of bad luck. It wasn't until sometime after the concept was scrapped that the crew replaced Félix with [[Adrien Agreste |Adrien]].
* [[Melodie]] — a female superhero who wields a flute.
* [[Mercury]] — a male superhero who appears to have super speed.
* [[Sparrow]] — a male sparrow-themed superhero who appears to use darts. In later development, producers replaced him with Kid Mime.

=== Members added in later development ===
* [[Gavroche]] — a male superhero.
* [[Kid Mime]]  — a male superhero with miming abilities. Producers replaced Sparrow with him.

== Trivia ==
* The [[Miraculouses]] did not exist in this concept, and the idea for them came to be after it was discarded.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/664048530869370880&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Original_Quantic_Team_Lineup.jpg|thumb|The three superhero members in the early version by [https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/648969656166952961 Thomas Astruc].]]
* Sparrow was originally a member of the superhero team, but producers replaced him with Kid Mime later on because &quot;[[Fred Haprèle|Mime]] was such great character that they didn't want to keep him as adult baddie only.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/648970732551176197&lt;/ref&gt;
* On Twitter, [[Thomas Astruc]] posted that he hopes he will be able to bring these characters back in comics someday.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/icandrawthings_/status/653052827883962368&lt;/ref&gt;
** He also mentioned that he doesn't believe that the Quantic Kids concept would've been as successful as the final version of [[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir|''Miraculous'']].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/857984633375531013&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Sparrow exists in the universe, his first appearance being in the ''Miraculous Adventures'' story &quot;[[Miraculous Adventures Issue 2|Trash Krakken Part 1]]&quot;. 
* In the first version of the [[Super Lady Luck|''Super Lady Luck'']] slot game, images of Melodie, Kid Mime, and Mercury appeared. In the current version, different images of Melodie and Kid Mime still exist, but Mercury no longer appears.&lt;ref&gt;http://demo.isoftbet.com/flashgames/launcher/?module=start_game&amp;identifier=lady_bug_pmvc&amp;casino=9&amp;forfun=1&amp;loginc=testuser35&amp;passc=testuser35&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some of the unused characters have similarities to other canon characters:
** Melodie wielded a flute like [[Lila Rossi|Volpina]] and [[Alya Césaire|Rena Rouge]].
** Melodie's civilian design has elements that were used in [[Chloé Bourgeois]]' [[:File:Miraculous Fashion show concept.png|earlier]] [[:File:HFjHsc6.png|designs]].
** The design of Gavroche is similar to [[Nino Lahiffe]]'s appearances as a civilian, and to Carapace as a superhero.

{{SpoilerButton}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/653886483649163264&lt;/ref&gt; is a man who loves pigeons. In &quot;[[Mr. Pigeon]]&quot;, after being kicked out of the [[Jardins du Trocadéro]] by [[Roger Raincomprix]] for feeding the pigeons, he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and becomes '''Mr. Pigeon''', a pigeon-controlling [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]]. 

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Xavier is tall and lean, with light brown hair and eyes and olive skin.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a grey elegant suit complete with a grey hat, a dark grey waistcoat decorated with a square pattern, a white shirt, a big teal bow tie, and brown sandals worn with white socks. He also has a bird call whistle on a string hanging from his neck.

=== As Mr. Pigeon ===
Mr. Pigeon wears a full body skin-tight suit with black forearms, waist and thighs, dark grey belly, light grey chest, shoulder and biceps, and pink shins and head. He also becomes noticeably more muscular. The suit also has black stripes on his triceps and around his upper hips, along with two parallelogram-shaped light blue spots where his bow tie was. The bird call whistle is still around his neck.

{{For2|more of Xavier’s outfits and designs|Xavier Ramier/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:MP (212).png|thumb|left|Xavier feeding the pigeons.]]
Xavier is a cheerful man who loves to take care of pigeons. He often goes to the park to feed them, even though it is not allowed, because he worries about them not getting fed if he doesn't do it. Also quirky, he walks to a bench as if he is a bird and talks to the pigeons.

He can also be very friendly and caring towards others, most notably with [[Marianne Lenoir]], whom he shows respect to and tries to comfort after she feels that [[Wang Fu|her love]] has forgotten about her. {{HideSpoiler|In &quot;[[Timetagger]]&quot;, he treats [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] to ice cream in order to apologize for being akumatized again. In the same episode, on Cat Noir's advice, he also seemingly develops an affection for rats over pigeons, feeling that the former are even cuter than they are.}}

As Mr. Pigeon, his love for pigeons is taken to an extreme, his desire being them taking over Paris. He still acts very pigeon-like, cooing and flapping his arms like wings. Proving to also be clever, he plans to trick Ladybug and Cat Noir into thinking that he abandoned the park guards, just to ambush them with his birds.

== Abilities ==

MP (829).png|Mr. Pigeon with a ball of pigeons on each arm.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Mr. Pigeon is able to communicate with pigeons and control them with his [[List of akumatized objects|bird call whistle]]. He can make them form into any shape he wants, like a plane or throne, or he can gather pigeons around his fists and throw them to attack. If he falls, the pigeons are able to catch him. He can also get them to capture and carry large objects, including a metal cage or other people. His control over them even allows him to command them to poop. However, the pigeons aren't entirely obedient to him if there is food around.

== Trivia ==
[[File:PV HQ (11).png|thumb|Mr. Pigeon's design in the Ladybug PV.]]
* Mr. Pigeon is one of the first known villains in the world of Ladybug, being one of the only three villains featured in the Ladybug PV with Hawk Moth and the [[Fred Haprèle|Mime]].
* Unlike most akumatized victims, Hawk Moth refers to him by his actual name, calling him Mr. Ramier before sending out an akuma.
* In &quot;Guitar Villain&quot;, he appears briefly, being forced to dance (alongside several pigeons) by the [[Jagged Stone|title character]].
{{HideSpoiler|
* In &quot;Timetagger&quot;, while facing Mr. Pigeon again at the Louvre, Ladybug mentions that he has been akumatized twenty-three times beforehand. He later appears as Mr. Pigeon again towards the end of the episode.
** Cat Noir mentions at the end of the episode that pigeons have it hard in Paris. In real-life, it is illegal to feed pigeons in Paris as they are considered pests, which would explain Mr. Ramier's reoccurring akumatization due to his over-protectiveness for pigeons.
** Though all but his first akumatization took place off-screen, Mr. Ramier has technically been akumatized more than any other character in the series, having been transformed back into Mr. Pigeon twenty-five times in total. 
** Additionally, in the same episode, it is implied that Mr. Ramier will be again akumatized into the villain &quot;Monsieur Rat&quot; at some point in the future.}}

{{Quote|I've been a police officer for fifteen years, and I firmly believe that every citizen is innocent until proven guilty.|Roger|&quot;[[Rogercop]]&quot;|quotelink = yes}}
'''Lieutenant {{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/755033027823046656&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/655995873147682816&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as '''Agent Roger''' or, formerly, '''Officer Roger''') is a policeman and [[Sabrina Raincomprix]]'s father. In &quot;[[Rogercop]]&quot;, when he is fired by [[André Bourgeois]] for refusing to arrest [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] for stealing [[Chloé Bourgeois]]'s [[Chloé's bracelet|bracelet]] without evidence, which would be in violation of the law, he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and becomes '''Rogercop''', a robot policeman [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Lieutenant Roger is at a medium height and a bit overweight. He has short orange hair, green eyes and a large nose.

=== Civilian attire ===
His police cap is dark blue and has the word &quot;police&quot; written in all capital white letters. He wears a blue polo shirt with a badge with the flag of France on his right arm. His shirt has three buttons, and beneath them are light blue lines. On his right wrist, he wears a wrist watch and on his left wrist, he wears a medical bracelet. He also wears dark blue pants with a black belt, a baton attached to the belt, and black work boots. His silver police whistle dangles from his neck.

=== As Rogercop ===
Rogercop is taller and more muscular, and he wears a dark blue robot suit. His chest, hands, the underside of his upper arms, behind, back of his legs, and hips are black. The [[List of akumatized objects|police whistle]] is still around his neck. Also, he has light blue lines around where his blasters are on the back up his forearms, around the black on his chest, and around the bottom of his feet. A hollow light blue triangle pointing downwards is at the center of his chest. His helmet includes a light blue line above a light blue shield in front of his eyes. His left shoulder and right shoulder have a blinking red light and blue light, respectively.

{{For2|more of Roger's outfits and designs|Roger Raincomprix/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:CC (257).png|left|thumb|Roger signaling the police force to not attack.]]
Roger is a very dedicated police officer, and he is firmly convinced that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. He disobeys André Bourgeois's orders to arrest Marinette without proof in &quot;Rogercop&quot;, since that would be in violation of the law, resulting in him being temporarily fired. He is strict, as seen when he throws [[Xavier Ramier]] out of the [[Trocadéro]] in &quot;[[Mr. Pigeon]]&quot; because of his habit of feeding the pigeons. He is also prideful about the police's ability to handle situations, telling Ladybug that they don't need her help in &quot;[[Copycat]]&quot;. He's known to be excessive when dealing with those who violate the law, as he piles tickets onto [[Adrien's bodyguard]] in both &quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot; and &quot;[[Gorizilla]]&quot;, as well as [[Anarka Couffaine]] in &quot;[[Captain Hardrock]]&quot;, even for very minor offences. However, when he isn't focused on his duties, Roger is friendly, loving towards his daughter and nice to other people.

As Rogercop, he is a merciless, emotionless, and law-dedicated drone who makes civilians do what he considers to be following the law. He strives for order and obedience, and he doesn't take kindly to people questioning his authority. Revenge also motivates him, as he wants to make André suffer consequences for firing him.

== Abilities ==

&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; crop=&quot;true&quot; widths=&quot;250px&quot;&gt;

RC S01EP09 (528).png|Rogercop's flying car.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Rogercop has blasters on his forearms that shoot handcuffs, one of them red and the other blue. When they attach to people, he can command them and blow his whistle to make them do whatever he wants, whether for a short period of time or continuously. The blasters can also fire tracking devices, which allow Rogercop to easily locate anyone or anything they attach to, like André Bourgeois' limousine. He is also able to attach his shoes to moving surfaces.

His car, having got an upgrade when he is akumatized, is able to fly. It also has an autopilot option so that he can do other tasks without having to drive.

== Family ==
{{Raincomprix Tree}}

== Relationships ==
=== [[Sabrina Raincomprix]] ===
[[File:RC S01EP09 (91).png|thumb|Roger presenting with Sabrina at Career Day.]]
Sabrina is his daughter, whom he loves a lot. In &quot;[[Santa Claws]]&quot;, he reassures her that they'll find her friend, the missing [[Adrien Agreste]].

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
In the few instances Roger has interacted with Marinette, he treats her respectfully while still acting professionally. He silently and suspiciously stares at her when she retrieves a pigeon feather at the [[Trocadéro]] in &quot;Mr. Pigeon&quot;, but he smiles at her after she leaves. Also, he defies André's orders to search Marinette for Chloé's bracelet in &quot;Rogercop&quot;, as he firmly believes in not breaking the law and jumping to conclusions without solid evidence.
[[File:CC (304).png|left|thumb|Roger and Ladybug arguing about Cat Noir's innocence.]]
With Ladybug, Roger appreciates her and Cat Noir's work as long as they don't cause any trouble for the public or the police. In &quot;[[Stoneheart (Origins - Part 2)|Stoneheart]]&quot;, he accuses Ladybug of failing with [[Ivan Bruel|Stoneheart]] previously and commands for her and Cat Noir to stay out of the police's way. The police officer and superhero also disagree about Cat Noir's innocence in &quot;Copycat&quot;. Although stubborn at times with Ladybug, he knows that she truly cares about protecting Paris. In particular situations, he openly wants her and Cat Noir to save him and others, like when he and other police officers get captured by the titular villain in &quot;Mr. Pigeon&quot;. Also, he sometimes shows pure gratitude towards her and her heroics, including when she destroys Hawk Moth's akuma projection in &quot;Stoneheart&quot; and when her [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]] returns the Mona Lisa in &quot;Copycat&quot;.

As Rogercop, he sees Ladybug and Cat Noir as being no longer needed to protect Paris. It takes a little time before he starts thinking of them as lawbreakers, as once he replaces André as the head power of Paris, he declares Ladybug and Cat Noir as fugitives.

=== [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien Agreste/Cat Noir]] ===
Roger doesn't know Adrien personally, however because he knows that Sabrina sees him as a friend, he determinedly searches for him with her in &quot;A Christmas Special&quot;.
[[File:CC (271).png|thumb|Roger trapping Cat Noir after deceiving him.]]
Rogercop feels the same about Cat Noir as he does with Ladybug, liking their heroics while not being troublesome to Parisians and the police. When [[Théo Barbot|Copycat]] impersonates Cat Noir and steals the Mona Lisa in the episode of the same name, Roger firmly believes that Cat Noir is the culprit, leading the superhero into a trap.

===[[Audrey Bourgeois]]===
In &quot;Style Queen&quot;, he is temporarily fired by Audrey Bourgeois.

=== [[André Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:RC S01EP09 (123).png|left|thumb|André firing Roger.]]
Roger respects and serves André, but he doesn't agree with André's impulsive orders that go against the law. Despite André commanding him to search Marinette, even stressing his authority as mayor, Roger stands his ground on not disobeying the law. While being Rogercop, he goes after André and blackmails him with his daughter so André will give Rogercop authority over Paris. After he is returned to normal, Roger gets promoted by André for finding Chloé's bracelet, and Roger thanks him, saying he is proud to be on the police force.

* There seems to be a wax statue of Rogercop at the [[Musée Grévin]].

He wears a white shirt underneath a dark green dress jacket. He also wears dark blue jeans and black and white sneakers. When he is performing as a mime, he has a black derby hat with a special pocket added in by [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] to put a photo of Mylène.

=== As the Mime ===
The Mime's hair is blond, and his skin is periwinkle. His irises are pale purple, and he has black lining around the eyes, with a drop shaped line below each. He still has the derby hat on his head. He wears a dark gray and white striped shirt underneath a bluish-gray dress jacket with two large black buttons and a dark blue collar. In addition, he wears high white pants with black lining on the pockets, and he wears high black and white sneakers.

== Personality ==
[[File:The Mime 147.png|left|thumb|Fred thanking Mylène for her introduction.]]
Fred is kind and hardworking. When he is working as an assistant at school, he is serious and firm about keeping people without permission and who might hurt others out, including [[Roger Raincomprix|Rogercop]] in the [[Rogercop|episode of the same name]] and [[Nadja Chamack]] and her crew in &quot;[[Darkblade]]&quot;, but when off duty, he is very genial to other people, and he is always showing love for his daughter. However, he tends to procrastinate, getting his hat fixed right before he needs to leave instead of having it done earlier, and he is often late.

As the Mime, he is cold and silent, with the only intention of getting revenge on his crew by ruining their show because he lost the opportunity to perform with them.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Fred is a talented mime actor, able to act with imaginary objects and without saying a word.

=== As the Mime ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Mime is able to mime anything, and instead of it being imaginary, it works like a real, solid, but invisible object. He can create anything, from swords, to bazookas, to working vehicles. He can also mimic strength, being able to hold up the [[Eiffel Tower]]. However, the Mime can only mime one thing at a time, so if he starts a new mime, whatever he previously created will cease to exist.

== Family ==

== Relationships ==
=== [[Mylène Haprèle]] ===
Mylène is his daughter and he loves her very much. He had Marinette place a pocket in his hat so he can keep a picture of Mylène there for good luck, and when he misses his performance, he believes he has disappointed her.

== Trivia ==
* [[File:Mime.jpg|thumb|Concept art for the Mime in the Ladybug PV.]]The Mime is one of the first known villains in the world of Ladybug, being one of the only three villains featured in the Ladybug PV, the other villains being [[Xavier Ramier|Mr. Pigeon]] and Hawk Moth.
** The Mime has the same abilities as he did in the Ladybug PV, the only difference being that there are no shadows visible when he pantomimes.
* The Mime was such a great character in producers' eyes that when the unused concept of the [[Quantic Kids]] was being developed, they decided to replace team member [[Sparrow]] with [[Kid Mime]], a superhero with powers like the Mime.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/648970732551176197&lt;/ref&gt;.
* For the Mime's objects, animators would create his objects, and then they would make them invisible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/Miraculous.Ladybug/photos/a.296331537138512.58163.290735154364817/763898560381805/?type=3&amp;theater Facebook post] from fan page with an image of the Mime being animated.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Mime's design is a reference to French mime [[Wikipedia:Marcel Marceau|Marcel Marceau]].&lt;ref&gt;https://lupintyde.tumblr.com/post/160589733402/the-miraculous-mime&lt;/ref&gt;
* Along with Horrificator, The Mime is the one of the two akumatized villains to not speak in Season 1.
**Coincidentally, they are both from the Haprèle family.
* The Scarlet Mime reappears in the two-part special event &quot;[[Heroes' Day]]&quot;.

{{Quote|Excuse me, young man. Hasn't anyone ever taught you to knock?|Mr. Damocles|&quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)|Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]&quot;|quotelink = yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the principal of [[Collège Françoise Dupont]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/651170953989218304&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[The Dark Owl]]&quot;, after trying and failing to become a superhero and being humiliated by the media for it, he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Dark Owl''', an Owl-themed [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BZg2ST6n097/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Mr. Damocles is a stout man with amber eyes. He has large, bushy black eyebrows, gray sideburns and beard, and a light gray mustache. He is bald on the top of his head.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a brown dress jacket with a white button-up undershirt, and he has a tie that is a lighter brown than his suit. His pants are a darker shade of brown than the jacket, and his shoes are brown loafers.

=== As Dark Owl ===
His eyes are round and yellow. His face is covered with a black mask, while there are brown circles with white edges around his eyes. The mask also includes two tuft-like points with brown tops that come out above his eyes and point backwards. His beard is brown, his mustache notably having tips sticking out, and two black vertical stripes go up it. He wears a black suit that includes brown covering and padding over his upper body, arms, and legs. The covering includes black or darker lines, and a brown symbol of an owl's face appears on the chest. Above his hips, he has a brown belt with two pockets towards his right side holding objects based on his symbol. He wears brown gloves that have two ridges each, brown boots with black soles, and a long cape that is black on the back and brown on the other side. The cape can also transform into a pair of wings that has a gray mantle along with several black feathers on either side of the wings.

== Personality ==
[[File:LW_S01EP07_(225).png|thumb|Mr. Damocles is pressured by Chloé to unfairly suspend Alya.]]
Mr. Damocles is serious, courteous, and authoritative, but he struggles under pressure, especially when [[André Bourgeois|Mayor Bourgeois]] dictates that the school must find his daughter [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]]'s missing [[Chloé's bracelet|bracelet]] in &quot;[[Rogercop]]&quot;, and when Chloé demands that he suspend [[Alya Césaire|Alya]] for taking a photo of her locker in &quot;[[Lady Wifi]]&quot;. As seen in &quot;[[Reflekta]]&quot;, he can be quite forgetful and stingy as well, not remembering who [[Juleka Couffaine|Juleka]] is when [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] states that she missed the class photo, and deciding to ignore her claims entirely when Chloé brings up the fact that he is paying [[Vincent]], the photographer, by the hour. Despite his flaws, Mr. Damocles can feel concerned over the well being of others, such as in &quot;[[Pixelator]]&quot;, when he questions [[Jagged Stone]]'s decision to face the [[Vincent Aza|titular villain]].

[[File:TDO_(79).png|thumb|192px|left|Mr. Damocles in his self-proclaimed superhero identity, &quot;The Owl&quot;.]]
As seen in &quot;The Dark Owl&quot;, Mr. Damocles holds admiration and respect for Ladybug and Cat Noir, so much so that he attempts to become a superhero himself, desiring to help others under the secret identity &quot;The Owl&quot; and showing that he has a good heart and intentions. However, he can be obtuse at times, not listening to Cat Noir and Ladybug when they urge him to stop his superhero antics so he won't endanger himself. After he is de-akumatized, he learns his lesson and decides to help out others by performing small deeds, without putting himself at risk.

As Dark Owl, he is vengeful towards Ladybug and Cat Noir for accidentally humiliating him, and desires to do the same thing to them. He strives to be the only hero in Paris, aiming to get rid of Ladybug and Cat Noir to achieve his goal. Intelligent and calculating, he fakes a scenario in order to trap the heroes. Despite his plans and hostility towards the heroes, he isn't needlessly evil, even chiding Ladybug and Cat Noir for believing he would really harm a kitten when his scenario is revealed to be a fake, and is still a man of his word, releasing the heroes from danger after they make the gesture of surrendering their Miraculouses.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Marinette|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien|Cat Noir]] ===
[[File:Catalyst_(206).png|thumb|Mr. Damocles talks about Ladybug and Cat Noir’s heroism]]
Mr. Damocles is very appreciative of the work Ladybug and Cat Noir do in order to protect Paris. He is inspired by them to create his own superhero persona, though he doesn’t listen to the duo when they try to warn him that what he’s doing may be dangerous. During Heroes Day, he talks to Miss Bustier’s class about the heroic deeds Ladybug and Cat Noir have done throughout the year.

As Dark Owl, he is vengeful towards Ladybug and Cat Noir for unintentionally humiliating him and seeks to get rid of them in order to become Paris’ only superhero.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:LW_S01EP07_(208).png|thumb|left|Chloé demands that Mr. Damocles suspend Alya.]]
Whenever Chloé threatens to phone her father, the mayor, for whatever reason, Mr. Damocles always complies with whatever demands she makes, such as unfairly suspending Alya from school in “Lady Wifi” and not punishing her like the rest of the school in “[[Despair Bear]]”. In “[[Malediktator]]”, like most of the school, he takes pleasure in Chloé leaving Paris.

=== [[Ms. Mendeleiev]] ===
When Ms. Mendeleiev has computer trouble in “Robostus”, Mr. Damocles happily tries to help her.

=== [[Markov]] ===
Mr. Damocles doesn’t believe that Markov has human emotions and dismisses him as a mere toy, even confiscating him from Max when he proves to cause trouble. Markov attempts to change his mind by talking to him about his IT skills, and though Mr. Damocles is momentarily intrigued, he soon believes himself to be crazy for talking to a toy and puts Markov in his drawer.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
[[File:TDO_(38).png|thumb|Mr. Damocles speaks to Albert, his computer program.]]
Calling it a hobby, Mr. Damocles has IT skills, helping [[Ms. Mendeleiev]] with her computer troubles and claiming that he created a program for his computer in &quot;[[Robostus]]&quot;. However, while having some ability, he still ends up letting a virus into the school's hard drive in the same episode. His program [[Albert]] has glitches and problems, but is designed well enough to recognize and respond to commands, albeit poorly and often unsuccessfully. Healso modifies his grappling hook when it fails to shoot correctly in &quot;The Dark Owl&quot;.

[[File:TDO_(284).png|thumb|left|The Owl modifies his gadgets.]]
When being The Owl, Mr. Damocles shows off his agility and skill at climbing a tree. However, his older age makes him less smooth in his maneuvers, being prone to falling over, and he is unskilled at throwing a boomerang or aiming and shooting a grappling hook gun.

=== As Dark Owl ===
[[File:DarkOwlSignal.jpg|thumb|Dark Owl's signal.]]
While Dark Owl doesn't have real superpowers, he has a wide arsenal of gadgets and tools, such as a fully functioning grappling hook, numerous owl-themed boomerangs, and wings that he can use to glide through the air. He also has a strong jump and enhanced combat capabilities, enabling him to efficiently battle with Ladybug and Cat Noir individually.

== Trivia ==
* The name [[wikipedia:Damocles|Damocles]] refers to a character from an ancient Greek story who, after praising the king's good fortune at his position of wealth and power, was invited to sit in the king's place on the throne, unaware (at first) that a sword hung over his head suspended by a single horse hair. The literal meaning of &quot;Damocles&quot; is &quot;fame of the people&quot;.
* Mr. Damocles' design is very reminiscent of an owl. He also has many pictures of different owls in his [[Mr. Damocles' office|office]].
* His akumatized form was first revealed as a silhouette in a promotional poster on [[Jeremy Zag]]'s Instagram.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
* In &quot;The Dark Owl&quot;, it is revealed that he is a fan of comic book superhero [[Knightowl]], owning various related comics and merchandise.
** While his homemade costume and his akumatized appearance are strongly based off of Knightowl's appearance from the in-universe comic books and merchandise, his akumatized form resembles the character Knightowl from the ''[[Miraculous Adventures]]'' comics.
*His akumatized villain costume is a modified version of his original costume, a trait similar to Chloé's akumatized villain costume in &quot;Antibug&quot;.
*He is is the first supervillain to successfully force one of Ladybug's Miraculous earrings off of her.
* As Dark Owl, he is one of a few villains to almost murder Ladybug and Cat Noir (by almost drowning them).

'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/660946813432823808&lt;/ref&gt; is the mayor of [[Paris]] and the owner of [[Le Grand Paris]]. He is also the husband of [[Audrey Bourgeois]] and the father of [[Chloé Bourgeois]].&lt;ref&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Qry0SBvmdNZjBrckwxb1Y4TU0/view?pli=1&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[Malediktator]]&quot;, after his wife and daughter tries leave [[Paris]] and calls him powerless despite his position, André is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Malediktator''', a dictator supervillain.

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;[[Loveater (Battle of the Miraculous - Part 1)|Loveater]]&quot;, André and his wife will be akumatized into '''Loveater''', a love-devouring supervillain.}}

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
André is a fairly tall and fat man with slicked back gray hair and light blue eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a dark gray dress jacket with three large black buttons over a white dress shirt. He has a dark red tie, and there is a dark red folded handkerchief in the jacket's upper left pocket. He also has dark gray slacks and black shoes. He usually wears a blue, white, and red striped sash over his right shoulder, and the ends of the sash are tied together next to his hips with thick golden tassels.

=== As Malediktator ===
Malediktator is a tall and muscular supervillian and he have grayish blue skin. On his head, he wears a dark blue bicorne. He wears a dark blue jacket with a cowl going over most of his head except the bottom of his nose and mouth, and the jacket has black and purple markings on the shoulders. Malediktator's right arm has a yellow armor-like shoulder with black stripes, and the rest of the arm is dark blue with a bent white and red stripe below the elbow. Across his chest and around his body, he wears a blue, white, and red sash with large blue, white, and red circle attached at the center of his chest above it. Also, he wears white trousers that start from the upper body, and he have dark blue boots that start above the knees.

{{For2|more of André's outfits and designs|André Bourgeois/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:RK (769).png|left|thumb|André terrified by Reflekta.]]
André is an approachable and regal man, though he is very willing to be manipulative, deceptive, and degrading when it comes to his political or personal goals. Rather prideful, André tends to care more about his wealth, prestige and [[Chloé Bourgeois]] (André's daughter) than the welfare of the people of Paris. He enjoys being rich and making more money as he notably allows [[Jagged Stone]] and his [[Fang|crocodile]] to occupy a room at Le Grand Paris upon learning that he is rich, but he doesn't like losing money. While capable of acting like a proud leader, he can also be quite a coward. If he is facing a villain or his daughter is in danger, André can easily become terrified and unsure what to do, but he will act professionally despite his fear under some circumstances. When serious, he knows when to listen to advice and commands from others, most notably from [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]]. He is easily persuaded by his family when they urgently need something, and scrambles to do their bidding, not caring if it is unfair. While André is typically more calm than passionate, he'll get angry when he feels like someone is harming or disrespecting him or something he cares deeply about. Specifically, his love for his daughter leads him to become furious if she is wronged in some way or in peril.

[[File:RC_S01EP09_(789).png|thumb|André apologizes to Roger]]Although open and prone to questionable choices and responses, André figures out his wrongdoings every once in a while. He sometimes unprofessionally jumps to conclusions about situations and demands action that goes against the law, but when he realizes his mistakes, he does try to learn from them and make things right with anyone he wronged, such as [[Roger Raincomprix]] in &quot;[[Rogercop]]&quot;. In another instance of this, in &quot;[[Reflekta]]&quot; he initially agrees to help the [[Juleka Couffaine|title villainess]] trick Ladybug and Cat Noir for Reflekta's promise to turn him back to normal in return, but later regrets his actions and agrees to Ladybug's request to drive Juleka back to school from the [[TVi studio]]. Albeit an egocentric leader, André can be genuinely kind and patient. He is grateful for good, hardworking, and brave civilians and heroes that thrive in Paris.

As Malediktator, he is a completely tyrannical supervillain who uses his powers to make others do what he wants. He still cares for his daughter, though, as he attempts to make her dreams come true so that she'll stay in Paris with him. 

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
As a leader and politician, André is good at presenting himself to the public, issuing orders and speaking to reporters on current issues. Also, as being a hotel manager, he helms a large staff and he expertly deals with the hotel's visitors and occupants.

=== As Malediktator ===
As Malediktator, he can make energy bubbles that, when they hit a person, can cause them to do what Malediktator wants, he does so by holding up two fingers and starting each command with &quot;By the power vested in me, I declare...&quot;, then gives his order. It was also shown that Malediktator is able to control his bubbles at will.

== Family ==

== Relationships ==
=== [[Audrey Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:AudreyBourgeois.jpg|thumb|André opens the door for Audrey.]]
In &quot;[[Frightningale]] &quot;, André is afraid of his wife as it is shown when he complies to Chloé's demands after she threatens to call her mother. He complies to every command she gives him, such as firing the chauffeur in &quot;[[Style Queen (Queen's Battle - Part 1)|Style Queen]]&quot; or hurrying to the Bourgeois helicopter in &quot;[[Mayura (Heroes' Day - Part 2)|Mayura]]&quot;. 

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:RC S01EP09 (159).png|thumb|André standing up for Chloé.|left]]
André loves his daughter, but he spoils her more than he should. He doesn't like to see her upset or in danger as he cares immensely for her happiness and safety that he acts rashly because of it every now and then. For her, he buys expensive designer clothes, threatens school staff with being fired if they fail to recover her [[Chloé's bracelet|bracelet]] and introducing her to [[Prince Ali]] at a press conference. If Chloé is being mistreated or humiliated, André takes it as a personal offense, even telling Parisians once that a strike on Chloé is a strike on Paris. Occasionally, however, he does remind her about being better, making sure she learned to not unfairly accuse others in &quot;[[Rogercop]]&quot; and punishes her like kicking her off of the jury of the [[World's Greatest Chef contest|''World's Greatest Chef'' contest]] in &quot;[[Kung Food]]&quot; for sabotaging [[Wang Cheng]]'s [[Marinette Soup|soup]].

In &quot;Malediktator&quot;, when Chloé threatens to leave Paris after he can't give her what she wants, he falls into sadness, which leads to his akumatization.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:MP CN in a urge.jpeg|thumb|André asking Ladybug and Cat Noir about dealing with Mr. Pigeon's pigeons.]]André doesn't know Marinette well, but he immediately believes Chloé's accusations about her stealing Chloé's bracelet in &quot;Rogercop&quot;. Also, while [[Hôtel de Ville]] is under siege in &quot;[[Darkblade]]&quot;, he follows her lead. He is aware Chloé doesn't like Marinette, but on Christmas, he wants Chloé to be nice to her in &quot;[[Santa Claws]]&quot;.
With Ladybug, André is extremely grateful for her work and he relies heavily on her to keep Paris safe — and in some cases, to keep him and his daughter safe. He also openly listens to her suggestions, agreeing with her to rehire Roger after unfairly firing him earlier in &quot;[[Rogercop]]&quot;.

=== [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] ===
In the same fashion as his feelings towards Ladybug, André is appreciative of Cat Noir for his duty to protecting Paris. When Cat Noir explains that he has an &quot;urgent need&quot; in &quot;[[Mr. Pigeon]]&quot;, André happily complies by allowing him into a suite and even having a chef get Camembert for him per request.

== Trivia ==
* The name '''André''' means &quot;man, warrior&quot; and/or &quot;Masculine; manly; brave&quot; in French. 
** '''André'''—sometimes transliterated as '''Andre'''—is the French and Portuguese form of the name '''Andrew''', and is now also used in the English-speaking world, particularly in the United States. It is a variation of the Greek name '''Andreas''', a short form of any of various compound names derived from '''andr'''-
* André's surname '''Bourgeois''' is a French term that is used to describe a member of the middle class within France. 
* In &quot;Darkblade&quot;, it is mentioned that André has been re-elected as mayor of Paris four consecutive times.
** A mayor's term in France is six years, so he has been mayor for about eighteen years. Thus at the end of his current term that starts in &quot;Darkblade&quot;, he will have been mayor for twenty-four years.
* As André states at the beginning of &quot;[[Simon Says]]&quot;, he dislikes dancing.
** He says the last time he danced was when Madonna was in kindergarten.
*** If this claim is true, he would be aged somewhere in his seventies considering that Madonna would have attended kindergarten in approximately 1963. If André was a teenager the last time he danced, he would have been born in the mid-1940s, and would thus be approximately 70 years old at the time of the series, give or take a few years.
* Malediktator was first revealed on August 31, 2017, at a TFou press conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://pandasuite.com/viewer/2.0.2/59a6c26e48abe6f53a002dc9?t=1 (direct video source [https://data.pandasuite.com/videos/59a3e7def643f27d7300131b-universal_1024_1024_20_main_3-0.mp4 here] and English subtitles [http://miraculousubs.tumblr.com/post/164947363272/the-careless-whisper-scene-at-the-end-really here])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Nobody has ever fully deciphered the hieroglyphics, but I have! It's a magic chant that needs to be recited in order to complete the ritual! I'm sure of it!|Jalil|&quot;[[The Pharaoh]]&quot;|quotelink = yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/653848134465007617&lt;/ref&gt; is a young historian and [[Alix Kubdel]]'s older brother. In &quot;[[The Pharaoh]]&quot;, after his theories about an [[Egyptian papyrus|ancient Egyptian scroll]] are disregarded by his [[Mr. Kubdel|father]], Jalil is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and becomes the '''Pharaoh''', a [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]] with the powers of each ancient Egyptian gods.

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Jalil is tall with chin-length reddish-brown hair and dark blue eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears glasses, an orange scarf, a [[List of akumatized objects|scarab pendant]], a white shirt with a golden Eye of Horus on it, a grayish-green jacket, beige jeans and sandals.

=== As the Pharaoh ===
&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; crop=&quot;true&quot; position=&quot;left&quot; widths=&quot;200&quot;&gt;
PH S01EP06 (218).png|Baboon face, when using the power of Thoth.

PH S01EP06 (329).png|Jackal face, when using the power of Anubis.
PH S01EP06 (659).png|Hawk face, when using the power of Horus.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Pharaoh is tall and muscular, his eyes are glowing blue and his skin is black, like the ancient dioritic statues of the pharaohs. He wears golden bands on his wrists, ankles and biceps, a golden mask (which resembles Tutankhamun's funerary mask) with a nemes, a fake beard and a cobra on the top, a golden shendyt (a kilt-like garment) and two necklaces. One necklace has three lines of beads (alternating light blue and white) connected by golden pieces. The second [[Jalil's necklace|necklace]] is his old scarab pendant that considerably changes after getting akumatized: it becomes light blue, flat and winged and has a sun disk above its head.

When the Pharaoh uses the power of a god, his face becomes the one of the god's sacred animal: when using the power of Thoth he gets a baboon face, for Sekhmet a lioness, for Anubis a jackal, and for Horus a hawk.

{{For2|more of Jalil Kubdel’s outfits and designs|Jalil Kubdel/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:PH S01EP06 (123).png|left|thumb|Jalil explaining his theory to his father.]]

=== As Jalil ===
Jalil is very passionate about his job: he is able to translate an ancient papyrus by himself and wants to perform the spell that is written on it. According to [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]], he jumps straight to conclusions, just like [[Alya Césaire]]. He is also willing to take the scepter from the exhibition to prove it, despite the spell being a theory and his [[Mr. Kubdel|father]]'s job being at stake if he touches it. He's also a bit clumsy, as shown when he runs to the exhibition and bumps into Marinette and Alya, dropping everything he's holding in the process.

=== As the Pharaoh ===
Pharaoh seems to believe that he is the ancient pharaoh Tutankhamun, and he tries at all costs to perform the ancient resurrection ritual for his wife Nefertiti: he's even willing to transform a hundred people in mummies and to sacrifice Alya to Ra.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Jalil is able to translate ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.

=== As the Pharaoh ===
As the Pharaoh, he gets supernatural strength, the power of telekinesis and the ability to perform an ancient resurrection ritual, which consist in using 100 mummies and a pure soul as a sacrifice to please the sun god Ra, who would then give Nefertiti back from the dead. The ritual requires Tutankhamun's scepter to shoot a ray towards a pyramid (like the one at the [[Louvre]]), which would then direct it towards the sky creating a black cloud, where the human sacrifice is supposed to go.
&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; widths=&quot;280&quot; crop=&quot;true&quot;&gt;

PH S01EP06 (582).png|The Pharaoh soaring with the power of Horus.
PH S01EP06 (615).png|Alya slowly rising towards the black cloud to be sacrificed.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

He's also able to use the power of an ancient Egyptian god at choice:
*'''Thoth''', the god of knowledge, gives him the power to create time-slowing bubbles that trap people. This may be due to the fact that Thoth is also the god of time measurement, and he once won 5 days gambling with Khonsu, the Moon, making the year of 365 days instead of 360.
*'''Sekhmet''', the goddess of fire, war, dance, love, the desert wind and medicine, gives him even more strength, making him able to create powerful shockwaves only by clapping his hands. This power may come from Sekhmet's name: &quot;sekhem&quot;, in ancient Egyptian, means &quot;power or might&quot;, so Sekhmet's name means &quot;the (one who is) powerful&quot;.
*'''Anubis''', the god of funerary rituals and (in more ancient depictions) death itself, gives him the power to shoot rays from his eyes that turn people into undead mummies under his control.
*'''Horus''', the god of the sky and kingship, gives him the power to fly.

== Family ==
{{Kubdel Tree}}

== Relationships ==
=== [[Mr. Kubdel]] ===
Jalil usually respects his father, but sometimes he doesn't when he is overconfident in his own theories, even to the point of willing to risk his father's job to prove them.

== Trivia ==
* In the original French language, the akumatized villain is called [[Wikipedia:Akhenaten|Akhenaten]], a genuine Egyptian pharaoh. This is perhaps ironic, as Akhenaten is remembered as the ruler who attempted to overthrow worship in the old gods and install a sun cult religion in Egypt, yet the Pharaoh actively calls on those same ancient pantheon gods, not Akhenaten's &quot;Aten&quot; sun disk god.
** Akhenaten is also the father of history's famous boy-king Tutankhamun, also known as King Tut.
* Although Jalil is the older sibling, Jalil's father gives the family heirloom [[Alix's watch|watch]] to Alix instead of him.
** In the French version, Mr. Kubdel says that the youngest child on his/her fifteen birthday inherits the watch.
* Despite the fact that the [[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir|show]] states that Nefertiti was Tutankhamen's wife, she was actually one of his father Akhenaten's wives.
** In the Korean version of the show, the Pharaoh tries instead to resurrect Ankhesenamun, Tutankhamun's half-sister and wife. However, this is still historically incorrect because Tutankhamun died before Ankhesenamun.
* Even though Thoth is represented as a Baboon when he uses his power Thoth was more commonly depicted as an Ibis in Egyptian mythology, although some Egyptians did believe he was a Baboon too.
* The Scarlet Pharaoh reappears in the two-part special event &quot;[[Heroes' Day]]&quot;.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' was an Egyptian woman around 5,000 years ago. She was a past [[Miraculous holders|Miraculous holder]], wielding the [[Ladybug Miraculous]] and transforming into Ladybug when [[Tikki]] inhabited them. She stopped King Tutankhamun I from sacrificing an innocent woman in order to resurrect his deceased wife, Princess Nefertiti. A depiction of her as a hieroglyph on a [[Egyptian papyrus|papyrus]] appears in the [[Louvre]].

In &quot;[[The Pharaoh]]&quot;, [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] learns of her existence (and of the long lineage of different Ladybugs throughout history) while preventing the same event that this past Ladybug dealt with, the [[akuma]]-[[Akumatized villains|created]] [[Jalil Kubdel|Pharaoh]] trying to use a sacrifice to resurrect Nefertiti.

== Appearance ==
As depicted in the hieroglyph, Ladybug wore a kalarisis with spots on the fabric and pasium around her neck. She also appears to have worn an Egyptian wig. To transform, she owned the Ladybug Miraculous.

== Abilities ==
If this past Ladybug had the same powers are the current Ladybug (Marinette), she had enhanced abilities and the superpowers [[Lucky Charm]] and [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]]. She also used the [[yo-yo]], as shown in the hieroglyph.

== Trivia ==
* While this Ladybug isn't the only previous Ladybug Miraculous holder to be pictured in the [[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir|series]], she is the only Ladybug revealed to Marinette and talked about so far, with her mission to prevent a sacrifice being explained by the Pharaoh.
* In the drawing by [[Feri González]], she is referred to as the Oracle of Khepri, the Egyptian God of Creation, the movement of the Sun, and Rebirth.
* ''daesuqat khinfasa' saghira ''(دعسوقة خنفساء صغيرة) means &quot;ladybug&quot; in Arabic.
* Since she stopped King Tutankhamun I's ritual of resurrecting Princess Nefertit and both their real world counterparts were born during the time of the New Kingdom of Eygpt it's possible that she was born in the same period.

'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/655346545068478465&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/655995481865244672&lt;/ref&gt; (called '''Nadia Chamack''' in some episodes) is a [[TVi]] news reporter and [[Manon Chamack|Manon]]'s mother. In &quot;[[Prime Queen]]&quot;, after [[List of minor characters/Humans#Arlette|Arlette]] cancels her [[Side by Side|show]], she is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Prime Queen''', a television and media controlling [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DisneyGermany&quot;&gt;https://www.fernsehserien.de/miraculous/folgen/2x02-prime-queen-1143806&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Nadja stands at a medium height with pale skin, brown eyes, and small pink lips. She has vibrant, short, fuchsia hair.

=== Civilian appearance ===
She wears an indigo blouse with a purple button and lining. Underneath, she wears a violet shirt with white accents. Around her neck, she has a gold chain necklace with a pale green five-petaled flower charm. She also wears a white watch on her right wrist, white jeans, and red shoes.
=== As Prime Queen ===
She wears a pixel-textured head helmet with a light blue visor, while her hair, being stiff, shinier, and wilder, is on the outside. Because of the visor, her lips and pupils are glowing pink while the rest of her face is blue. She wears a dark blue pixel-textured bodysuit with a pattern of glowing light blue rectangular outlines connected with lines. Her lower arms and lower legs are fuchsia, and around her legs above the ankles is a thicker band with a glowing blue edge. The bottom of the suit combines with fuchsia high platform shoes.
{{For2|more of Nadja's outfits and designs|Nadja Chamack/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:AM-(521).png|left|thumb|Nadja reporting on the animal invasion caused by Animan and Mayor Bourgeois' response.]]
Nadja is nice, informative, and interested in getting the details on an event to [[Paris]]. She gets impatient if she has to wait too long, and she sometimes goes too far in her quest for news, being insensitive with [[Armand D'Argencourt|Armand]] when she tries to interview him after his loss at the election to [[André Bourgeois]] in &quot;[[Darkblade]]&quot;. However, she is fearless in her quest to spread the word, even willing to interview the [[Vincent Aza|titular villain]] of &quot;[[Pixelator]]&quot; and calling herself the reporter who &quot;spreads the villains' voice.&quot; Through all of her reports, she is professional and formal, but at the same time, she willingly expresses concern or happiness during particular instances. She is friendly to others, and she is very motherly to her daughter, though willing to discipline her.

Prime Queen, while good at onscreen presentation and strategics, is haughty and demanding, wanting [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] to announce that they are in love. Her obsession with the heroes makes her more than willing to force them to reveal their identities on live television for Hawk Moth, and she blackmails them by endangering civilians [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]] and [[Alya Césaire|Alya]] without remorse. However, her desire for answers makes her act rashly, her aggravation of not being able to see Ladybug and Cat Noir detransform and kiss driving her to travel to them, falling for their trap.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Nadja is a very persistent news reporter in her job, using whatever means necessary to find a story even if it gets into others' personal lives.

=== As Prime Queen ===
Prime Queen's power allows her to travel between television screens. Any television affected by her power can be used by others to travel from place to place. For communicating with others, she can control television screens to broadcast her actions from another television screen. However, if the television screen is destroyed, she can't use it to teleport or broadcast anymore.

Additionally, she is decently skilled in combat, and she is effective at tying Chloé up in a blue power cord.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Manon Chamack]] ===
[[File:TPT_(1316).png|thumb|Nadja hugging Manon after they are reunited.]]
Manon is Nadja's daughter, whom she loves. While she can be very stern with her, like when she finds out Manon has one of Marinette's [[Marinette's dolls|dolls]] and mistakenly believes she stole it, she means well, caring about her safety and wanting her to learn good virtues. Although Nadja has gotten used to Manon's baby doll eyes, she notes that Manon can be &quot;very persuasive.&quot; She also worries greatly when she can't go and find Manon in &quot;[[The Puppeteer]]&quot;, and she is relieved once she reunites with her.

[[File:TPT_(1334).png|thumb|left|Nadja accepts Marinette's apology.]]Nadja appreciates that Marinette babysits Manon for her, and she understands Marinette's difficulty with Manon sometimes and her intentions to do the best she can with her. She forgives Marinette for her giving Manon a doll against orders in &quot;The Puppeteer&quot;, and although she is at first getting impatient waiting for a cake delivery at [[Tom &amp; Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie]] that Marinette is supposed to retrieve for her in &quot;[[Timebreaker]]&quot;, she is content once Marinette shows up, apologizes, and gives her the cake.
[[File:TPT (906).png|thumb|Ladybug promising Nadja that she'll save Manon.]]

With Ladybug, Nadja is grateful for her and Cat Noir's work to keep Paris safe. Many of Nadja's news reports are related to the villains that create trouble and the heroes that defeat them. During Manon's akumatization, Nadja feels slightly better after Ladybug reassures her that they'll find her daughter, and she thanks her when she is with Manon once more. Her interest in Ladybug also extends to knowing if she and Cat Noir are dating, but her asking and prodding push Ladybug too far in &quot;Prime Queen&quot;. It becomes her obsession to see the duo romantically together while being Prime Queen. She later accepts with calm understanding when Alya tells her that the superhero duo aren't dating &quot;yet.&quot;

{{Quote|But Master, the Miraculouses are not meant to be used for evil purposes!|Nooroo to [[Gabriel Agreste]]|&quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)]]&quot;|quotelink = yes}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;http://avatartagg.tumblr.com/post/140270207743/me-earlier-what-is-the-right-spelling-for-the&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Kwamis|kwami]] of '''Transmission'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/1050451327497752579&lt;/ref&gt; who is connected to the [[Butterfly Miraculous]], and with his power, his [[Miraculous holders|wearer]] can use the brooch to transform into a butterfly-themed superhero, the current wearer being [[Gabriel Agreste]], who uses it for evil.

== Appearance ==
Nooroo is a little, purple, butterfly-like creature, who is 10 centimeters tall.&lt;ref&gt;Confirmed to [[User:BelieveInMagic814]] by the official [https://officialmiraculousladybug.tumblr.com/ Miraculous Ladybug Tumblr blog].&lt;/ref&gt; He has butterfly wings that have a long tail with a tip at the end of each lower wing and dark purple eyes. There is a slightly dark purple spiral mark on his forehead and one on each lower part of the back of his wings.

{{For2|more of Nooroo's designs|Nooroo/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:OR1-(31).png|thumb|left|Nooroo attempts to tell Gabriel that the Miraculous aren't meant for evil.]]
Nooroo is a knowledgeable, helpful, and empathetic kwami. He shows a bit of his curious side in &quot;Gorizilla&quot; when Gabriel thought [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]] might be Cat Noir.

Though he reluctantly succumbs to [[Gabriel Agreste|Gabriel]]'s demands to help him get the [[Ladybug Miraculous]] and [[Cat Miraculous]], Nooroo is distressed that he is helping someone use the Butterfly Miraculous for evil reasons. He also has a formal side, calling his holder ''Master'' instead of his real name.

[[File:SB_(81).png|thumb|Nooroo scared by Gabriel.]]
In addition to this, Nooroo is sometimes scared of Gabriel and is quite meek with him, such as in “Syren”, when Gabriel interrogated him on how to obtain more powers. Also in “Sandboy”, when he attempts to sneak away but is caught by Gabriel, Nooroo appears frightened and meekly tries to explain his motives. When Gabriel later learns that there are more kwamis and tells Nooroo that he wants to find them all, Nooroo is scared and concerned for his friends.

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;Stormy Weather 2&quot;, Nooroo demonstrates a remorseful side, being aware of the damage that's been happening with his powers.}}

== Abilities ==
[[File:HMTS (11).png|thumb|left|Nooroo transforms Gabriel into Hawk Moth.]]Nooroo is able to fly, levitate, phase through solid objects, and carry things that are large and/or heavy for him.

As a kwami, Nooroo gives the wearer the power of transmission and transforms them into a moth-themed superhero by entering the Butterfly Miraculous. Whenever the wearer uses [[Akumatization]], Nooroo begins losing power and eventually detransforms in about five minutes, although the specifics of the power that starts the power loss is currently uncertain. Then Nooroo has to recharge by eating.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Gabriel Agreste]] ===
[[File:OR1-(39).png|thumb|Nooroo conceding to Gabriel's orders, unwillingly.]]
Nooroo is treated like a slave by Gabriel and is completely under his will. He isn't pleased with his treatment or being forced to help a villain, but he submits to Gabriel's commands as he has no choice and tells him everything he wants to know. While Nooroo does attempt to tell him that the Miraculouses aren't meant to be used for evil, Gabriel refuses to listen and even yells at him.

[[File:SB_(87).png|left|thumb|Nooroo asks Gabriel if he can go out for his birthday.]]
Nooroo is not allowed to be more than a few feet away from Gabriel or communicate with anyone else besides him as seen in &quot;Sandboy&quot;. He also isn't always sure what Gabriel is thinking or feeling, surprised when Gabriel renounces him in &quot;[[The Collector]]&quot; and &quot;[[Queen Wasp (Queen's Battle - Part 2)]]&quot;. Despite his master mistreating him all the time, Nooroo still cares about Gabriel’s condition as seen in “[[Mayura (Heroes' Day - Part 2)]]” after the latter de-transforms upon suffering from a huge defeat.

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;[[Stormy Weather 2]]&quot;, despite being afraid of Gabriel, Nooroo does gain the courage to advise him to spend more time with his son and to stop his dark path before he loses him, though Gabriel refuses to listen and even seals his mouth shut.}}

=== [[Adrien Agreste]] ===
[[File:GZ_(293).png|thumb|Nooroo asks Gabriel if Adrien really is Cat Noir.]]
Nooroo hasn't met Adrien in person, but he does know that he is Gabriel's son and expresses curiosity over the possibility of him being Cat Noir in &quot;[[Gorizilla]]&quot;.

{{HideSpoiler|During &quot;[[Stormy Weather 2]]&quot;, Nooroo is even caring towards Adrien. When Gabriel senses negative emotions, Nooroo believes that they might be Adrien's and advises Gabriel to spend more time with him.}}

=== [[Kwamis|Other Kwamis]] ===
[[File:SB_(869).png|thumb|left|Nooroo becomes concerned for his kwami friends.]]
Nooroo appears to be quite close to the other kwamis and likely misses them a lot. In “[[Sandboy]]”, the kwamis try to communicate with Nooroo to wish him a happy 3500th cycle and save him from Hawk Moth's control, but the plan goes awry. When Gabriel later tells Nooroo that he wants to capture all the kwamis as to have unlimited powers at his disposal, Nooroo becomes very concerned for his friends.

===[[Duusu]]===
{{HideSpoiler|Nooroo appears to be friends with Duusu, and in &quot;[[Reflekdoll]]&quot;, he seems to be deeply concerned for her mental condition.}}

== Trivia ==
* In some dubs Nooroo has a noticeable feminine voice, although he continues to use masculine pronouns.
** In the Korean and Turkish versions of the series, Nooroo's proper pronoun is she/her.
* The swirl on Nooroo's head resembles the proboscis of a moth or butterfly.
* In [[Miraculous: Les Aventures de Ladybug et Chat Noir (comic)|''Miraculous: Les Aventures de Ladybug et Chat Noir'']], Nooroo states that he grants the power of generosity.
* As of &quot;Sandboy&quot;, Nooroo is 3,500 cycles old as well as the youngest of the kwamis.
* At present, Nooroo, along with [[Duusu]], are the only known kwamis to have fallen into the hands of a villain. 
* Nooroo's name is an African variant of the name Nuru meaning &quot;born in daylight&quot; or &quot;light&quot; referencing that butterflies are diurnal. His name also means &quot;the time of night&quot;, referencing from his moth based appearance and that most moths are nocturnal.

== Personality ==
Ms. Mendeleiev is a strict, sharp-tongued and grouchy teacher who expects her students to be hardworking, focused, and well-behaved, and she becomes cross with her students who are not. She is easily irritated by people bossing her around, but she shows some fear if she finds herself in serious trouble, like with [[Roger Raincomprix|Rogercop]] in the [[Rogercop|episode of the same name]]. She can also be incredibly stubborn and rude, as shown in &quot;[[Robostus]]&quot;, in which she refuses to believe both [[Max Kanté]] and [[Markov]] when they claim the latter has real, human emotions. Despite this, she can be tricked somewhat easily, finding herself dumbfounded after [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] manipulates her into letting her see [[Mr. Damocles]] in &quot;Robostus&quot;.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''',&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Miraculous.Ladybug/photos/a.296331537138512.58163.290735154364817/705833112855017/?type=3&amp;comment_id=708898409215154&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=15&amp;comment_tracking={%22tn%22%3A%22R0%22}&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''Miraculous wielders''',&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/660369187953618944&lt;/ref&gt; are people who own [[Miraculouses]] and use them to transform (with the help of [[Kwamis|kwamis]]) into animal-themed super-powered beings.

== History ==
After the Miraculous jewels were made it was the job of the [[Order of the Guardians]] to protect and distribute them to the people for the good of mankind. For the next 5000 years, many people throughout the world and history were picked by the guardians to become a holder. These recipients would be chosen through passing a test that showed their best personal characteristics and qualities, such as Marinette and her willingness to help others as well as Adrien and his kindness. Or like Kim in &quot;Party Crasher&quot;, who unknowingly save a guardian from real danger. However, just as there are good people there are also bad people who sought the jewels' power for their own gain, putting the world in danger or were never being meant to have them, such as present-day Hawk Moth. In such cases it's been the task of some Miraculous holders to assist in helping the guardians retrieve the jewels and stop the people who misuse them, in addition to protecting the world from other dangers. Once their task was complete or when some of them couldn't continue their job as Miraculous holders due to the other reasons the jewels were returned to the guardians or new holders were chosen to act in their steed by the guardian's permission or if they can't intervene first.

During their adventures some miraculous holders have experienced other powers and abilities with their jewels when needed or under great emergency like the Miraculous potion power ups used by Piao Chong and other holders as well as new fusion forms. In doing so, some wielders have made long lasting bonds with their kwamis receiving a [[kwagatama]] as a sign of friendship between them.

== Abilities ==
[[File:Marinette tranforming.gif|left|thumb|Marinette transforming with the help of her kwami, Tikki.]][[File:Adrien_transform.gif|thumb|Adrien transforming with the help of his kwami, Plagg.]]
In order for a Miraculous holder to transform, they need to be wearing the Miraculous and have the kwami connected to the Miraculous on hand to be absorbed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Through transformation, they change into an animal-themed superhero. In these forms, the Miraculous holder gains enhanced physical abilities, a [[Miraculous tools|tool]] (such as [[Yo-yo|Ladybug's yo-yo]]), and a superpower (such as [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir's]] [[Cataclysm]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/660373733396373504&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:TB_detransforming.jpeg|thumb|left|Ladybug detransforming.]][[File:SS (575).png|thumb|Cat Noir detransforming.]]

Not only that the holders also gain the abilities of the animals the miraculous were based off of. Such as enhanced senses like Cat Noir's hearing, smell, night vision and using his clawed gloves like actual claws to climb surfaces as well as Ladybug's ability to walk on walls like a bug.

Miraculous holders are almost invulnerable while transformed, but they are not exempt from everything such as drowning unless they're in Aqua Mode or using their weapons as breathing devices. While not transformed, the Miraculous has no effect. For example, a Miraculous holder could not survive jumping off a high building while not transformed.

In &quot;Miraculer&quot;, Miraculous holders do have some resistance to their own powers while transformed but it will leave them injured and possibly on the verge of death if struck, as with Cat Noir and his Cataclysm.

While they are almost invulnerable, they must be wise about how they use their superpower.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/660372597926993920&lt;/ref&gt; Because after it is used, the kwami loses the energy needed to keep the transformation, and in about five minutes the Miraculous holder reverts back to normal as the kwami emerges from the Miraculous.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/653210855102877696&lt;/ref&gt; If they want to transform back, they need to help their kwami regain energy back by feeding them. Not only that some powers are strictly linked to a holder's weapons likes Ladybug's Lucky Charm and her yo-yo which is also a weakness. Meaning that while a holder is using their weapons to summon their powers during the process they can't use them to attack or defend leaving them vulnerable to an attack seen with Ladybug in &quot;Sandboy&quot;.

However, it is unknown if Rena Rouge, Carapace, and Queen Bee all share the same weakness with their powers and weapons. As well as unknown if something like that does happen will cause the detransformation of the wielder or not let alone giving them the chance to use their powers again since the process was interrupted. If a holder relies on their hands to summon their powers like Cat Noir's Cataclysm and yet has them restrained or becomes separated from their weapons their powers can't be used.

According to Plagg the suit that the Miraculous transformation creates is &quot;what you really want, deep down&quot;. Upon transforming some holders with impairments like poor eyesight can modified or fixed completely like with Alya when she transforms into Rena Rouge and Nino when he transforms into Carapace.

Miraculous holders can use more than one Miraculous at the same time, which is why [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] desires both the [[Ladybug Miraculous]] and [[Cat Miraculous]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/658401978473652228&lt;/ref&gt; Other than gaining more power, the result of doing this is unknown, like if the holder keeps one animal-themed form while still having access to the other power(s).

{{HideSpoiler|However when a person utilities more than one Miraculous, their suit takes on a hybrid form. Combining aspects of the suits of each individual Miraculous allowing said user the ability to use both Miraculouses powers and weapons. Just like the Ultimate power besides needing two Miraculous an incantation or potion is possibly needed but it's unknown which one is used to unlock a hybrid form.

When a hybrid form is unlocked the holder can fuse together the two powers of the Miraculouses they're using into a fusion attack.}}

It is possible that Miraculous holders can restrict their kwamis to certain commands, as seen in &quot;Sandboy&quot;. However, it is as of yet unknown whether this is some outside ability of Gabriel or a benefit of being a miraculous wielder.

In &quot;Syren&quot;, Miraculous holders can have access to other powers when their kwamis drink certain potions from the Miraculous Spellbook:
*When in Aqua Mode the holder has the ability to swim and breathe underwater.
*When in Ice mode, the holder has Ice skating abilities.

In &quot;[[Mayura]]&quot;, if a Miraculous holder is in any of their powered up forms like Aqua or Ice mode they'll detransform into their normal superhero forms.

It turns out that some Miraculous abilities don't reveal themselves to their holders until they become of age like with Ladybug and Cat Noir still being &quot;too green&quot; with their powers. One of the abilities an adult Miraculous holder can gain is the ability to can retain their transformations even after using their superpower and prolonged use of their powers revealed by Hawk Moth in &quot;Mayura&quot;.
{{HideSpoiler|And by Alix's future self Bunnyx in &quot;Timetagger&quot;. It's seen that when a Miraculous holder grows to be an adult or has mastered their powers they don't need a voice command to activate them, as Bunnyx fought Timetagger she used her powers without saying the word &quot;Burrow&quot; the same number of times. Another ability could be is being able to limit how much power a holder uses with their powers. For example, when the Rabbit Miraculous was struck with a Cataclysm by the Future Cat Noir it was cracked (or it's possibly that it didn't receive a full blast) compared to the Bee Miraculous when it was completely destroyed by a younger Cat Noir in &quot;Queen Wasp&quot;.}}

Miraculous holders can also use Miraculous jewels that are damaged or negatively impacted and yet they must tread with extreme caution. Because it can result in damaging a holder's powers or have negative effects on the holder. As seen with Nathalie in &quot;Mayura&quot;, such as fatigue and possible health problems but they can overcome them or build a resistance over time. Just like a damaged or negatively impacted Miraculous, a holder can transform with a sick or hurt kwami however they too must tread with extreme caution. Because it's unknown what will happen to the holder or the kwami during and after the transformation.
{{HideSpoiler|Another negative effect could be the possibility of leaving the holder stuck in their superhero form seen in &quot;Timetagger&quot; until said jewel can be repaired but the full extent of using a damaged Miraculous is unknown.}}

&quot;Silencer&quot; shows how important a Miraculous holder's voice is while they're transformed. Since they use their voices to activate their powers and transformations, if a holder has their voice taken away they can't summon their powers as seen with Ladybug. By extension of that they won't be able to detransform resulting in them being stuck in their superhero form unless they remove their jewels. Even so, if a Miraculous holder has their voice taken away before they transform they can't transform at all. All vocal commands of a holder's powers can only be done by the voice of the holder the jewel was assigned to meaning that a Miraculous holder can't activate the powers of another holder unless they switch their Miraculous. Or when one holder comes into the possession of another holder's jewel like Ladybug with Cat Noir's ring in &quot;Gamer 2.0&quot;.
{{HideSpoiler| In &quot;Reflekdoll&quot;, it's revealed that a Miraculous holder can transform while under the effects of an akumatized villain if they remove their jewels before they get effected.}}

{{HideSpoiler|Miraculous holders seemingly do not age while transformed, as Bunnix was able to remain in the obelisk for thousands of years in &quot;Timetagger&quot; before being released from a deep sleep. However, it is unknown if this ability is exclusive to Rabbit Miraculous holders, applies to all Miraculous holders, or if it is simply just an ability of the obelisk she was trapped in.}}

== Trivia ==
* The physical appearance of the Miraculous holders from their transformations seems to vary between the individual, the time, and the place.
** And according to Plagg in &quot;[[Frightningale]]&quot;, it is influenced by the holder's tastes and desires.
* The poses made by Miraculous holders when they transform are purely symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/718393891930640385&lt;/ref&gt;
* The transformation sequences are about sixteen seconds.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/thomas_astruc/status/655341332806959104&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each Miraculous holder is able to choose their own name/superhero identity.&lt;ref&gt;https://officialmiraculousladybug.tumblr.com/post/159164068727/do-all-miraculous-holders-share-the-same-name&lt;/ref&gt;
* While transformed, holders cannot experience pain and have some level of invulnerability to physical damage, although the extent of this invulnerability is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/748196365738590212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winny&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/749226984375476224&lt;/ref&gt;
** However, if holders get hurt before they transform, they will still be hurt afterwards, like when Adrien hurts his ankle and retains the injury after becoming Cat Noir in &quot;[[Riposte]]&quot;.
** If their endurance and stamina is pushed to the limit they will experience some level of fatigue or pain, as seen in &quot;[[Robostus]]&quot; and &quot;[[Mayura (Heroes' Day - Part 2)|Mayura]]&quot;.
*** In &quot;[[Weredad]]&quot;, when Cat Noir briefly held his arm or when he collapsed on Ladybug's shoulder out of exhaustion.
** It turns out in &quot;[[Miraculer]]&quot; that the invulnerability of a Miraculous holder reaches its limit if they're on the receiving end of a [[Cataclysm]] or powers that can cause them harm. Leaving them very weak afterwards and implying they'll be close to death if not healed by the Miraculous Ladybug (superpower) in time.
* Some elements of the costumes of transformed Miraculous holders (such as Ladybug's and Cat Noir's masks) cannot be removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winny&quot; /&gt;
** However, on some superheroes, there are elements, such as Cat Noir's tail, that can be detached.
** There are some elements, made to look like real animal parts such as Cat Noir's and Rena's ears and yet they are fake but can enhance a wielder's senses.
* In &quot;Mayura&quot;, [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] reveals that Miraculous wielders can stay transformed even after using their superpower, however it isn't fully explained how.
** {{HideSpoiler|As of &quot;[[Timetagger]]&quot;, it's revealed that the ability to stay transformed after using their powers and multiple or prolonged use of said powers develops upon reaching adulthood.}}
* Wielders can voluntarily detransform, even if the time limit has not been reached.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/752739180363538432&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although there are cases where Miraculouses end up with holders that Master Fu wasn't involved with, such as Hawk Moth, Fu mentions in &quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)]]&quot; that he has personally made one mistake in a choice for a Miraculous holder, whose identity is currently unknown.
* Miraculous holders can continue owning their Miraculouses to any age as long as they're using them and their bodies are capable.&lt;ref&gt;https://curiouscat.me/MiraculousMX/post/257061723&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are upcoming special episodes that will explore past Miraculous holders, as confirmed by [[Jeremy Zag]] at a panel at the 2016 Los Angeles Comic Con.&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/IsTygn5xxZs?t=222&lt;/ref&gt;
** The official Miraculous Ladybug Tumblr blog responded to a question that past Cat Miraculous holders will be heard about in the future, along with more history of Miraculouses and presumably some of their holders in the series, comic books, and webisodes.
* Miraculous holders can be akumatized, as revealed in &quot;[[Queen Wasp (Queen's Battle - Part 2)|Queen Wasp]]&quot;.
* [[Thomas Astruc]] explained that the crew plans to keep expanding the [[Quantic Universe|universe]] by adding new characters and revealing more about all of the Miraculouses in the [[Miracle Box]], though Ladybug and Cat Noir will always be the main focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://tvmag.lefigaro.fr/programme-tv/thomas-astruc-avec-miraculous-nous-savons-ou-nous-voulons-aller-_351d4a80-b341-11e7-8aca-c6cafecb3960/&lt;/ref&gt;
* As of &quot;Mayura&quot; and future episodes, France holds the record for having the most Miraculous holders in one place with a total of seven, with the addition of past and future Miraculous holders making sixteen, followed by China with a total of nine.
** Including future forms as a result of fusion, swapping or having different Miraculous jewels the total number of forms is 22 but the total number people is still sixteen since seven of those future forms will be unveiled by people who already were Miraculous holders.
*** On an interesting note, France is the third country in history to have a team of Miraculous holders followed by China and Japan.

== Personality ==
[[File:PH S01EP06 (119).png|left|thumb|Mr. Kubdel listening to Jalil's theories.]]
Mr. Kubdel is reserved yet gentle. He cares deeply for his kids, he is very fond of history, and his is a good listener.

=== [[Alix Kubdel]] ===
[[File:Timebreaker (178).png|thumb|Mr. Kubdel telling Alix to take good care of the watch.]]
Mr. Kubdel loves his daughter, although finding it a bit odd how she doesn't act more formally in particular cases. He is patient with her when she doesn't initially show interest in the [[Alix's watch|watch]] when he gives it to her, and he understands her loyalty to her friends.

=== [[Jalil Kubdel]] ===
While loving his son, Mr. Kubdel sometimes gets exasperated with Jalil's quickness to jump to conclusions and his tendency towards reckless actions.

* He previously owned the family watch before giving it to Alix.
** Based on his explanation of how the watch is handed down to the youngest child in the family in the French version, Mr. Kubdel is either the youngest child or an only child to receive the watch from one of his parents.

{{Quote|To think that not so long ago, my ancestor's flag was waving above Paris...|Armand|&quot;[[Darkblade]]&quot;}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a fencing and PE teacher at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/666241353253322752&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[Darkblade]]&quot;, after losing [[Paris]]' mayoral election to [[André Bourgeois]] and being publicly humiliated for it, [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] infects him with an [[akuma]], transforming him into '''Darkblade''', a medieval knight [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Armand is a tall, thin and muscular man with a small amount of dark brown hair atop his head and blue eyes. He has a long and narrow with a large curly mustache.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a white fencing outfit, with thin red, white, and blue lines on the sides. On top of it, he wears a black fencing guard that is attached with two gray straps. On the left side of the guard, there is a silver shield symbol with a black phoenix-like creature. He also wears white boots that end below the kneecaps with thin red, white, blue lines over the toes. When he is fencing, he uses a white fencing mask.

=== As Darkblade ===
Darkblade wears a full suit of dark gray armor, some parts of it having lighter gray with dark gray stripes. The visor on his helmet has four red leaf-shaped marks, and the helmet's comb is large and red, its shape a bit zigzagged. The besagues have red curled outlined designs on them, and on the center of the breastplate, there is a red family crest design with a black outline and a black phoenix-like creature inside. His couter and poleyns and pointed, and the end of the sabatons are pointed. His sword is large, with a silver and dark gray striped hilt and a dark gray blade with red lines making a design on each side. At the middle of the cross-guard, there is the same family crest symbol as the breastplate, except it inverts colors and glows when it is shooting energy.

== Personality ==
[[File:DB S01EP12 (300).png|left|thumb|Armand teaching Adrien.]]
Armand is a serious and proper who is inspired by the ideals of knights from the medieval ages, and he is bitter with how underhanded tactics resulted in his [[Darkblade (ancestor)|ancestor]] losing his rule over Paris. He didn't run for mayor of Paris because he wanted revenge, but he is frustrated with his loss to [[André Bourgeois]] and how everyone takes him for a man obsessed with medieval times, whether true or not. To [[Adrien Agreste]] and his other fencing students, he is challenging, but good at teaching them and helping them improve.

As Darkblade, he is commanding and obsessed with conquering Paris. Power-hungry and enraged with the current government system, Darkblade wants to take over the country his ancestors lost centuries before, and he has nothing against turning everyone into knights that will follow him to victory.

== Abilties ==
=== As a civilian ===
Armand is very skilled at fencing, and is knowledgeable enough about it to be a teacher. A special move he uses, which was created by his ancestor Darkblade, involves pretending to be open for attack, just to suddenly fight back and knock their weapon away.

=== As Darkblade ===
&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; widths=&quot;250&quot; crop=&quot;true&quot;&gt;

DB S01EP12 (834).png|The black cloud spreading over Paris after Darkblade's flag has been planted.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Darkblade is able to create energy from the shield symbol in the middle of the cross-guard and shoot it into people's eyes. His victims kneel down, and then he touches their left and right shoulder with his sword as a way of knighting them. After that, the victims glow bright green and they transform into knights wearing dark gray armor with bright green designs on their epaulets and helmets. Each knight carries a dark gray and neon green battle axe, the blade being green with a black design and the handle having the family crest of Darkblade where it's connected with the blade. All of the knights are in full armor and have the same size, height, and, attitude regardless of their previous proportions. Under Darkblade's control, the knights follow his order and do any action he requires of them.
Darkblade can also transform a vehicle, in the same process that he uses for his knights, into an old-fashioned catapult. He also has improved sword fighting abilities, and he still likes to use the Darkblade technique.

Additionally, if Darkblade manages to plant his family's flag on top of the [[Hôtel de Ville|City Hall]], a dark cloud spreads over [[Paris]]. After the cloud stops expanding, it creates a circular black barrier on the extremity that shrinks inwards, turning everyone it passes through into his knights. They will glow dark green and stand up when struck. The knights will begin marching to him, awaiting instructions.

** As such, Darkblade is one of the villains who Hawk Moth technically doesn't name, the others being [[Mylène Haprèle|Horrificator]], [[Lila Rossi|Volpina]] and [[Nora Césaire|Anansi]]. 
* Unlike most villains, Darkblade never makes an attempt to get the [[Ladybug Miraculous|Ladybug]] and [[Cat Miraculous|Cat]] [[Miraculouses]].
* Scarlet Darkblade reappears in the two-episode special event &quot;[[Heroes' Day]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfou&quot;&gt;https://pandasuite.com/viewer/2.0.2/59a6c26e48abe6f53a002dc9?t=1 (direct video source [https://data.pandasuite.com/videos/59a3e7def643f27d7300131b-universal_1024_1024_20_main_3-0.mp4 here] and English subtitles [http://miraculousubs.tumblr.com/post/164947363272/the-careless-whisper-scene-at-the-end-really here])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I'm a genuine rock 'n' roller, not some pop star in diapers. I'm a real artist. Real talent! Even my hair is real. And that's what people love about me. Isn't that right, Fang?|Jagged|&quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot;|quotelink = yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a popular rock star. In &quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot;, after he is insulted on television by [[XY]], he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and becomes '''Guitar Villain''', a guitar-playing [[Akumatized villains|villain]].

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Jagged Stone is tall with pale green eyes. He has black hair with dyed purple tips, a black beard, and a mustache which connects with his beard. His eyebrows are black and split in two at the sides.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears heavy, dark eyeshadow and eyeliner. His outfit includes a sparkly black jacket with yellow accents and yellow epaulets. His pants are yellow with black vertical stripes, similar to a bee. He wears lacy, black finger-less gloves on both hands. His shoes are black heeled boots with a design on the soles. Around his neck is a necklace comprised of two golden wings with a pendant of a skull in between the wings.

=== As Guitar Villain ===
Guitar Villain's hair is in long dreadlocks and is light pink with a darker shade of pink at the tips. On his face, he has black shiny face paint around his eyes, and his eyes are blue. He wears a dark gray sleeved top with pointed edges over the shoulders, a turtleneck collar, and a vertical yellow leaf shape on each side of the front.

== Personality ==
[[File:PX (230).png|thumb|Jagged Stone playing with Fang.|left]]
Jagged Stone is wild, proud, and expressive. When he isn't on-screen or performing, he is relaxed and natural. But he prefers exciting things, like owning a [[Fang|crocodile]] for a pet, and he likes getting lots of attention, especially from his fans, as long as they give him enough space. He gets bored if nothing interesting is going on, and he doesn't like losing attention. However, while he likes being noticed, he believes that the most important thing about music is expressing himself, not the fame and fortune that comes with it. He is usually kind toward others, even being quite patient with the people he truly likes, but if he feels like he is being wronged by someone, he stands up for his beliefs and isn't afraid to get into heated disagreements with them.

As Guitar Villain, he is even wilder and crazier, and will express rage towards people he dislikes. He wants to make XY pay for insulting him, and he enjoys using his powers to make people rock out to his music, or in some cases to make them suffer.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Jagged Stone is an accomplished singer and guitar player. As seen in &quot;[[Pixelator]]&quot;, he is also skilled at playing the piano. While under the control of [[Wang Cheng |Kung Food]] in the [[Kung Food|episode of the same name]], Jagged is capable of proficiently wielding a large club made of seafood. 

=== As Guitar Villain ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Guitar Villain uses his guitar, which is the [[List of akumatized objects|akumatized object]], as his weapon. He is able to shoot energy waves of weaponized sound from his guitar, which have different powers according to the chord he plays:
* The purple wave, which he calls the &quot;Rockin' Riff, Baby!&quot;, causes those it hits to begin to dance uncontrollably and shout like they're at a rock and roll concert. This wave even works on animals and non-living things, such as cars.
* The orange wave, which he calls the &quot;Awesome Solo,&quot; is a concussive blast, able to destroy things and injure people, and is powerful enough to crack solid stone.
* The green wave, which he calls the &quot;Ultimate Solo,&quot; can cause tremendous earthquakes.
He also uses it as a melee weapon when fighting with Cat Noir.

A connected aspect to Guitar Villain is that Fang is transformed into a dragon by his akumatization. Fang can fly, and he can shoot blasts of green smoke at enemies. Guitar Villain also uses him to transport him anywhere and to protect him from the superheroes.


== Relationships ==
{{SpoilerButton}}
=== [[Fang]] ===
[[File:PX_(505).png|thumb|Jagged gives Fang a bath.]]
Jagged Stone loves his pet crocodile dearly, treating him like a dog. He pets and grooms him, and he takes him with him using a leash. Jagged is very knowledgeable about what Fang's needs are. Jagged doesn't appreciate it when people don't understand Fang's needs and requirements, including [[André Bourgeois]]. When Fang is pixelated by [[Vincent Aza|Pixelator]] in the episode of the same name, Jagged is horrified, calling out for Fang.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:GV (1013).png|left|thumb|Jagged Stone examining Marinette's cover design.]]
Jagged Stone is impressed with Marinette's artistic abilities. He loves the [[Jagged Stone's glasses|glasses]] that she makes for him in &quot;Pixelator&quot;, and he requests for her to make the cover for his new [[Rock Giant|album]] with faith that she'll create it to reflect his personality and style. When Marinette turns up with a cover based off of [[Bob Roth]]'s demands, he isn't upset at her, and he gives her another chance to make it. With Marinette's final product, he is very pleased, grateful for her work and dedication to his style.

He even spends time with her during the show ''Fill My Shoes''. When he and Penny stumble into her room in &quot;[[Troublemaker]]&quot;, he is amazed by Marinette's talent as designer and finds her crush about Adrien ''cute'' inspiring him to write a song.

[[File:PX_(740).png|thumb|Jagged being guarded by Ladybug.]]
Jagged also highly appreciates Ladybug. In &quot;[[Pixelator]]&quot;, after Ladybug saves him from the titular character, he dedicates an entire song to her out of gratitude. Despite this, he doesn't like Ladybug enough to appreciate her taking attention away from him during his interview. In [[Butler Jean]]'s flashback in &quot;[[Antibug]]&quot;, Jagged Stone is pleasantly surprised when he sees Chloé dressed as Ladybug and mistakes her for the super-heroine. Immediately afterwards, he notices the difference between Ladybug and Chloé's hair. In &quot;Heroes Day&quot;, he becomes disheartened when Ladybug was akumatized despite it being one of Volpina's illusions.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:DB S01EP12 (453).png|thumb|left|Jagged Stone getting bored at Chloé’s event.]]
In &quot;[[Darkblade]]&quot;, Jagged Stone gets hired by André to give signed CDs to Chloé's friends in order to help Chloé become class president at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]]. He appears very bored with the event. Also, when he realizes Chloé is dressed up as Ladybug in &quot;Antibug&quot;, he is displeased, but when Chloé gets hit by her yo-yo's string, it amuses him.


=== [[Penny Rolling]] ===
[[File:PX (99).png|thumb|Penny informing André what Jagged needs.]]
Jagged Stone has trust in Penny's judgment. When complicated circumstances arise, they can quickly agree on how to make the best of the situation at hand. Penny always makes sure that Jagged is satisfied and not bothered, and takes care of things for him when he is either busy or unavailable by any means.

[[File:TRB_(93).png|thumb|left||Jagged kisses Penny's cheek.]]
In &quot;[[Troublemaker]]&quot;, Jagged is shown to frequently rely on Penny for schedulings and arrangements and compliments her by calling her &quot;the best&quot; and kisses her on the cheek, leaving Penny to flush. After Penny is de-akumatized, a relieved Jagged rushes up to Penny and hugs her, expressing his admiration and gratitude for his agent.

=== [[Bob Roth]] ===
[[File:GV_(1018).png|thumb|Jagged gets irritated with Bob.]]
Jagged Stone is annoyed with Bob's bossy and opinionated attitude and dislikes his ideas of a duet with XY and an album cover based off of XY's style. If Bob does something Jagged doesn't agree with, he confidently fights back, by using Fang to threaten him or by reminding him that any other record company would be happy to publish him.

=== [[Vincent Aza]] ===
[[File:PX_(162).png|thumb|left|Jagged annoyed by Vincent.]]
Vincent's obsessive fan nature disturbs and annoys Jagged Stone. Not seeing Vincent as a friend, Jagged doesn't want anything to do with Vincent and wishes for Vincent to leave him alone. When Vincent is akumatized as Pixelator, Jagged is terrified of him, but when people's lives are on the line and it gives him an opportunity to make an appearance to his fans, Jagged boldly goes out of hiding and distracts Pixelator by allowing him to take his picture.

=== [[XY]] ===
[[File:GV_(317).png|thumb|Jagged gets extremely angry when XY insults him on live TV.]]
Jagged Stone has a deep disliking of XY and his music. He doesn't consider him a real musician, even refusing to do a duet with him when Bob suggests it. He is also very deeply offended when XY calls him &quot;uncool&quot; and a &quot;dinosaur&quot; during a live TV interview, so much so that he winds up breaking his tablet and feeding it to Fang. As Guitar Villain, he is very malicious towards XY, wanting to make him suffer for his insults and considering himself better than him.

{{HideSpoiler|
=== [[Anarka Couffaine]] ===
It's revealed in &quot;[[Desperada]]&quot; that Anarka and Jagged used to play music together, but they separated for some reason. After he let go his lattest guitarist, Jagged tried to convince Anarka to play with him again, but she refused to do it. Even more, she got mad at Jagged for lying to her about his guitarist having abandoning him, when the truth was he was the one to fire her. Anarka let go her anger on Jagged after he apologized to Vivica and hired her back.}}

{{SpoilerButton}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''', nicknamed '''The Gorilla''', is [[Adrien Agreste]]'s bodyguard and car chauffeur. In &quot;[[Gorizilla]]&quot;, after he fails to get Adrien back and gets harshly insulted by [[Gabriel Agreste]] for it, he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by Hawk Moth into '''Gorizilla''', a gorilla-like [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].&lt;ref&gt;https://pandasuite.com/viewer/2.0.2/59a6c26e48abe6f53a002dc9?t=1 (direct video source [https://data.pandasuite.com/videos/59a3e7def643f27d7300131b-universal_1024_1024_20_main_3-0.mp4 here])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For2|more of Adrien's bodyguard's outfits and designs|Adrien's bodyguard/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:SS (130).png|left|thumb|The bodyguard seeing Simon Grimault as a threat to Adrien.]]
Adrien's bodyguard is a serious, grim, and stoic man who never talks or express any emotions. He takes his job very seriously and is quite protective of Adrien, threatening [[Simon Grimault]] when the latter just wanted to shake hands with Adrien. His suspicious nature also thrives outside of his job as he glances at [[Marinette]] from a distance because she is talking back to her [[Marinette's purse|purse]], where [[Tikki]] is, in &quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot;. He isn't afraid to stand up to what he considers dangerous to himself or others, like Simon Says and [[Armand D'Argencourt|Darkblade]], but he becomes fearful in particular cases he is endangered. While not openly genial, the bodyguard obeys his boss Gabriel and [[Nathalie Sancoeur|Nathalie]]. He follows through on requests on others, such as delivering Marinette's [[Adrien's Christmas hat|Christmas gift]] to Adrien in &quot;[[Santa Claws]]&quot;.

{{HideSpoiler|Underneath Adrien's bodyguard's intimidating exterior, he is shown to gentle and kind as briefly played with action figure dolls and secretly allowed Adrien's friends into the Agreste mansion. He can also be easily moved as seen in &quot;[[Reflekdoll]]&quot;, when he sees the girls sincerely beg him to allow Adrien to have fun with them.}}

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
The bodyguard is a very strong man as he is able to use his height and build to intimidate others if necessary. When [[Simon Grimault|Simon Says]] hypnotizes him to act like a gorilla, he is powerful enough to attack and restraint [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]].

=== As Gorizilla ===
Gorizilla possesses extraordinary strength and an acute sense of smell, as well as a strong jump. Because of his enhanced senses and physical abilities, he is an excellent tracker, being able to follow Adrien just about anywhere after getting his scent from his bracelet. However, if his sense of smell is overpowered by a stronger scent, like [[Wayhem]]'s bottle of ''Adrien: The Fragrance'', he loses the ability to sniff out whoever he's trying to track. 

== Relationships ==
=== [[Adrien Agreste]] ===
[[File:GT_(591).png|thumb|The bodyguard attempts to protect Adrien from Gigantitian.]]
The bodyguard is very protective of Adrien, leaving his side only when forced to, like when he is chased off by spiders summoned by [[Santa Claus|Santa Claws]]. In general, he seems to be very fond of Adrien, showing signs of genuine care towards him. In &quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot;, when he is about to be akumatized from his frustration with parking the limousine, the mere sight of Adrien safe is enough to calm him down and repel the [[Akuma|akuma]].

=== [[Gabriel Agreste]] ===
[[File:GZ_(342).png|thumb|left|The bodyguard gets upset when Gabriel yells at him in a voicemail.]]
The bodyguard does his best to follow Gabriel’s orders of protecting Adrien, though in situations when Gabriel gets angry at him for whatever reason, he can get nervous or frustrated.

* [[Thomas Astruc]] and the crew call him &quot;the Gorilla.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/669059488666820608&lt;/ref&gt;
** As revealed in &quot;Adrien's Double Life&quot;, Adrien calls him &quot;the Gorilla&quot; because he has a large build and he doesn't talk at all.
** In &quot;Simon Says&quot;, the title character hypnotizes the bodyguard to think he is a gorilla. 
** In the French version of &quot;The Puppeteer&quot;, [[Plagg]] also refers to him as &quot;The Gorilla,&quot; while he simply refers to him as Adrien's bodyguard in the English version.
** In some languages (including French), &quot;Gorilla&quot; is a slang word used to describe a particularly muscular bodyguard.
* In &quot;The Bubbler&quot;, the bodyguard can be spotted in the sky to the right of [[Tom Dupain]] and [[Sabine Cheng]] when they are trapped in bubbles.
* He really likes Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/669429291806031873&lt;/ref&gt;
* In &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, the bodyguard is helping out [[Vincent]] by holding up a reflector during Adrien's photo shoot in the park. 
* Although the car he usually drives appears in &quot;Kung Food&quot;, he himself does not.
* An image showing part of the bodyguard's akumatized form was teased in a sneak peek collage at the ''Miraculous'' San Diego Comic-Con 2017 panel.&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/vtO8bbvmU0g?t=1586&lt;/ref&gt;
* The akuma in &quot;Gigantitan&quot; was intended to akumatize the bodyguard, but it ended up akumatizing [[August]] instead.
* The name of his akumatized form, Gorizilla, is a pun on his nickname and Godzilla. Coincidently, both have Gorilla in their names, representing their strength and power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/godzilla.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gorizilla reappears for the two-part special event &quot;[[Heroes' Day]]&quot;.
*In &quot;Oblivio&quot; he is listed as &quot;G.&quot; in [[Adrien's cellphone]], though this is likely short for &quot;Gorilla&quot;.

== Personality ==
[[File:Princess Fragrance 463.png|left|thumb|Prince Ali looking out the window to see the fireworks display.]]
Prince Ali is kind and fun-loving. Due to his royalty, he is expected to act regal and to be safe, which he finds difficult, considering that he greatly enjoys doing new and exciting things.

Able to recognize authenticity in people, he doesn't like good actions coming from selfish reasons, but he appreciates real, genuine compassion.

== Relationships ==

=== [[List of minor characters/Humans#Prince Ali's chaperone|Prince Ali's chaperone]] ===
Prince Ali is almost always seen with his chaperone. However, he tends to take advantage of moments when she is away, in order to do things she did not plan or does not approve of.

=== [[Rose Lavillant]] ===
[[File:Princess Fragrance 1169.png|thumb|Prince Ali suggesting to Rose that they depart to the hospital.]]
Touched by Rose's compliments, Ali asks Rose to accompany him to the children's hospital where he plans to volunteer and thereby befriends her. In the end card of &quot;[[Princess Fragrance]]&quot;, he can be seen watching fireworks with her.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
After Chloé gives him [[Tikki]] as a gift for the sick children, believing her to be a stuffed toy, Prince Ali is slightly confused by Chloé's false modesty, and later on, he turns her down to spend time with [[Rose Lavillant|Rose]].

Wang is an excellent cook, who wins the title of The World's Greatest Chef. His most notable dish is Celestial Soup, which he would later rename Marinette Soup after his [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|great-niece]]. While his native language is Mandarin, he is able to speak a little English, although he states his abilities are terrible.

=== As Kung Food ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Everybody who tasted Kung Food's tampered soup prior to him being akumatized is brought under his control as minions, and gain enhanced martial arts abilities. As a sign of this, their eyes become dark brown/dark ochre. Kung Food also can create any food-based weapon he desires with his satchel. He can either wield these weapons himself or give them to his minions.

The objects and weapons he produced include:
* A flying rice ball that can record footage to project a hologram to Kung Food or project a hologram of Kung Food to others.
* A mace made out of seafood.
* A flail made out of potatoes, sausages, lettuce and carrots.
* A crossbow made of cheese that fires stinky cheese bombs.
* A bow and arrows made out of candy.
* Tonfas made out of maki sushi.
* A sword made out of pepperoni pizza.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:KF (1001).png|thumb|left|Wang Cheng teaching Marinette how to make his special Soup.]]
Wang meets his great-niece when he visits her house before the World's Greatest Chef contest. While it's not initially obvious to Marinette, Wang cares for her and appreciates her kindness and hospitality. He uses the flowers she gives him in his soup and, after losing the contest, realizes that Marinette was right about Chloé sabotaging his dish. When remaking his soup, Wang Cheng shows Marinette how to make it when she requests he show her, and he renames it after her.

Prior to visiting Paris, Wang was unaware of who Ladybug is. After being akumatized into Kung Food, Hawk Moth explains who Ladybug and Cat Noir are and Kung Food decides to cook them in his &quot;Brat Soup&quot; in order to give it &quot;superhero flavor.&quot;

=== [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien Agreste/Cat Noir]] ===
[[File:KF (168).png|thumb|right|Wang Cheng interacting with Adrien.]]
Wang gets along well with Adrien, conversing with him in Chinese on their drive to Le Grand Paris and telling him how he plans to use Marinette's flower gift to decorate his dish.

Much like with Ladybug, Wang was unaware of who Cat Noir is before visiting Paris and wants to cook him in his soup after becoming Kung Food.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:KF (298).png|thumb|left|Chloé faking innocence after tampering with the soup.]]
Wang Cheng didn't think much of Chloé until he realizes that she ruined his soup for the contest, much to his anger. When transformed into Kung Food, he has her captured and plans to get revenge on her by cooking her into &quot;Brat Soup&quot;.

== Trivia ==
* Adrien and Hawk Moth both refer to him as an artist.
* Wang is the first akumatized character who doesn't appear in the [[It's Ladybug|theme song]].
** He was originally meant to appear in the theme song, however, as seen in the [[:File:Miraculous Ladybug OP Animatic|animatic]].
* He is the first akumatized character to be related to Marinette.
** Other akumatized characters to be as such include her grandmother [[Gina Dupain]]{{HideSpoiler| and her father [[Tom Dupain]]}}.
* Kung Food's face markings are a reference to the Monkey King.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/686632858765627392&lt;/ref&gt;
** Kung Food's design might also reference Goku's Super Saiyan form from ''Dragon Ball Z''. Goku's design, in turn, is based on the Monkey King. 
***Adding to the Dragon Ball connections, the character's English voice actor, [[Todd Haberkorn]] is also known for voicing Android 19 in Dragon Ball Z, Kai and Jaco in Dragon Ball Super.

{{Quote|Now, who likes having his belly scratched? Daddy's little Fang!|[[Jagged Stone]]|&quot;[[Pixelator]]&quot;}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is [[Jagged Stone]]'s pet crocodile. In &quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot;, when [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] [[Akumatization|akumatizes]] Jagged Stone into Guitar Villain, he is affected as well and transformed into a dragon.

== Appearance ==
Fang looks similar to a saltwater crocodile. He is a large and pale brown reptile with jagged teeth and golden eyes.

As a &quot;helper&quot; to Guitar Villain, Fang is a large purple dragon with large wings and brilliant green eyes.

{{For2|more of Fang's outfits and designs|Fang/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:PX (109).png|left|thumb|Fang looking at André Bourgeois.]]
For a crocodile, Fang acts rather tame as he is never seen attacking people and seems fine with being a pet. As seen in &quot;The Collector&quot;, where he seems to enjoyed his owner's performance. He also has some dog-like behaviors as he wags his tail and hangs his tongue out of his mouth, as seen in &quot;[[Pixelator]]&quot;. Fang doesn't like being pestered and growls at [[Bob Roth]].

== Abilities ==
=== As a villain ===
When Jagged is akumatized and becomes Guitar Villain, Fang also transforms into a dragon. In this form, Fang can fly and breathe green blasts of energy. 

== Relationships ==
=== [[Jagged Stone]] ===
[[File:GV_(62).png|thumb]]
Jagged is Fang's owner. Fang appears to enjoy Jagged's company, even putting up with a collar around his neck, and he acts as a dog would to his owner. Jagged love Fang dearly and treats him like a dog . Jagged pets and groom Fang every day . Jagged is very knowledgeable about what Fang's needs is . Jagged doesn't appreciate it when people don't understand Fang's needs and requirements, including [[André Bourgeois]] . 

Fang is also shown to care a lot about Jagged as he growls and glares at Bob in order to help him out in &quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot;. When Fang is pixelated by [[Pixelator (character)|Pixelator]] in the episode of the same name, Jagged is horrified, calling out for Fang.

=== [[Vincent Aza]] ===
Unlike Jagged, Fang likes Vincent and smiles while wagging his tail when he is around.

=== [[Bob Roth]] ===
Fang is irritated with Bob. If Jagged needs to force Bob to do something, Fang growls and glares at him as a way of threatening him.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
After Chloé repeatedly drops her yo-yo on his head in &quot;[[Antibug]]&quot;, Fang becomes angry and bites off the yo-yo string, causing the string to fly back at Chloé's face.

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Vincent is tall with pale skin, teal eyes, and blond hair, with the tips of his hair dyed pale pink in an ombré manner.

=== Civilian attire ===
Vincent wears a white t-shirt with a v-neck, jagged sleeves, and Jagged Stone's face logo in black on the front. On the back of the t-shirt is black text with Jagged Stone's name above a list of places. He has black, fingerless, lace gloves with thick black bands around the ends of the holes. Also, he wears a black belt with a dark gray buckle, dark blue jeans with three horizontal holes on each front upper leg, and black boots with silver back heels and silver skulls above the ankles.

=== As Pixelator ===
Pixelator has a full body suit that is mainly black with blue areas and thin glowing light blue stripes, with his face being the only part of his body revealed. The top of his head is blue, with his hair, entirely bubblegum pink-colored, sticking out and brushed towards the right side of his head. His skin is tanned. Around his head and covering his eyes, he wears a black circled piece with a glowing light blue horizontal stripe in the middle on the front, a light blue circle line with lines inside over his ears, and a blue camera with a white spot beside it, black buttons on the side and a lens over his left eye. At the center of his chest, there is a pixel image of a lens surrounded by light blue, with a black pixel outline and purple, blue, and white pixels making up the lens. Blue areas of the suit are around his upper shoulders, partially on the sides of the front, around his waist, his forearms, the fronts of his upper legs, and his lower legs. The light blue stripes, some ending with circular ends, are vertically down the sides of his shoulders, on the sides of his upper arms, around his neck to the center, and down the center to the middle of his lower legs. Other lines are on the sides of his upper legs, the backs of his lower legs, and the front of his waist as stripes. His feet, mostly covered with blue, have black soles and toe covers, with light blue lines up sides, around the sole.

== Personality ==
[[File:PX (160).png|thumb|Vincent attempting to take a picture without Jagged Stone’s consent.|left]]
Vincent is obsessive about Jagged Stone, considering themselves as best friends despite not knowing him personally. He does creepy, immoral, and stalker-like things as his fan, such as spying on him to take pictures, following his mother, and having a shrine in with room with photos of him. He doesn't believe that his actions are immoral, and he is upset when Jagged Stone tells him they're not friends and [[Penny Rolling]] forces him to stay away from the rock star.

As Pixelator, he is still intent on getting a great picture with Jagged Stone, but he is also sly, malicious, and prideful. He tricks people into believing he is taking pictures of them, even flattering Chloé in order to capture her. However, his passion for Jagged Stone is stronger than his obedience to Hawk Moth and his focus to take the [[Miraculouses|Miraculouses.]] This leads to physical threats from Hawk Moth to stay focused and clouded judgment when he trusts Ladybug to let him know Jagged Stone's whereabouts instead of capturing her.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Vincent knows how to use a camera to take pictures.

=== As Pixelator ===
&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; widths=&quot;240&quot; crop=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
PX (345).png|Pixelator's view of people he is about to pixelate.
PX_(350).png|People being pixelated after Pixelator shot them.
PX_(402).png|Adrien and Chloé stuck in a photography world.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Pixelator can take pictures with the camera over his right eye, which he can see through. When he hits the button, a light blue ray of pixels shoots out. If it hits a person or animal, the pixels surround them. The pixels then disperse, the victims were gone. The pixels reform the victims in a white world inside of a photograph, the photograph themselves appearing on Pixelator's wall in his room, where they can move and be seen moving from the real world. The people trapped there can see each other, but they can't reach each other. If a person in the real world looks at their picture, a screen of them forms in the photography world for the trapped victims to see and talk to. If only a body part gets hit with the pixel blast, it becomes pixelated and intangible.

To release his victims, Pixelator presses his left ear, and the people convert back to pixels and return to where they were previously before returning to normal.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Jagged Stone]] ===
Vincent considers himself Jagged Stone's greatest fan. He attends all of his concerts, takes and keeps multiple pictures of him, and even followed Jagged Stone's mother to the bingo hall. After Jagged openly expresses his dislike of him and has Penny force him away, Vincent becomes disappointed with his idol, not understanding why Jagged would do such a thing. As Pixelator, he continues to be obsessed with Jagged Stone, and it proves to be his greatest weakness when Hawk Moth has to threaten him to focus on defeating Ladybug and when he loses track of Ladybug when Jagged Stone offers to let him take a picture of him.

=== [[Penny Rolling]] ===
When Vincent is caught by Penny trying to take photos of Jagged at Le Grand Paris in &quot;Pixelator&quot;, he is kicked out of the hotel by the latter, not before threatening him to break his camera if she ever finds him around Jagged again. Later, Vincent appears as Pixelator, meeting Penny again. While not recognizing Pixelator as Vincent, Penny appears annoyed when Pixelator knocks on the door to Jagged Stone's suite, suspiciously asking who he is before he pixelates her.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
When Vincent as Pixelator enters the hotel, he is confronted by Chloé, who tells him that only the biggest celebrities, like Jagged Stone and / or herself, are allowed to stay in her father's hotel, showing her dislike for non-celebrities entering her father's hotel. However, Pixelator then asks to photograph her, which she allows.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a hypnotist.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://www.telequebec.tv/les-aventures-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir/epi023ladybug&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/689718078440116224&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[Simon Says]]&quot;, after [[Gabriel Agreste]] gets him disqualified from [[The Challenge|''The Challenge'']] by refusing to accept his challenge, he is infected with an [[Akuma|akuma]] by Hawk Moth and becomes '''Simon Says''', a [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]] who can hypnotize anyone.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAvMacVQ9OV/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/689699709846458368&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==

=== Physical appearance ===
Simon is tall, having very wavy brown hair and pale grayish-blue eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a high-collared white dress shirt underneath a dark gray vest with black buttons, along with a black bow around the collar. On top, he wears a dress jacket that's lavender with fuscia circles with red swirled lines inside as a pattern, along with a black collar, black cuffs, and coattails. He also wears dark black slacks and black shoes.

=== As Simon Says ===
Simon Says is bald, his eyes are dark gray, and his skin is pale periwinkle. He wears a bright green top hat with the bottom of the bill being black and a purple ribbon around the crown. A black mask is over his eyes, and the area close to the eyes is colored indigo. He wears a body suit below the head with a light gray high collar and front, with a large black bow pattern on the front below the collar. The left side of the top of the suit is green with a purple left glove and butterfly sleeve edge, and the right side and bottom of the suit are purple with a green right glove, green butterfly sleeve edge, a green left leg that starts in the middle of the upper leg, and a green right leg that starts below the knee.

== Personality ==
[[File:SS (198).png|thumb|left|Alec’s teasing making Simon nervous.]]

=== As Simon ===
Simon is soft-spoken, nice, and nervous. He likes his work, but he doesn't lie about his skills. However, he is upset if he feels wronged, bothered that he is kicked off ''The Challenge'' despite it being Gabriel's fault that he failed his task.

=== As Simon Says ===
As Simon Says, he is outspoken, eccentric, commanding, and overconfident. He thinks fast and uses his cards wisely to get people to do what he wants them to. He is persistent in succeeding to get revenge on Gabriel and get [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]]'s [[Miraculouses]] for Hawk Moth.

== Abilities ==

=== As a civilian ===
Simon is a skilled hypnotist and magician, using cards to hypnotize people.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Simon Says uses his cards to control people and make them do his bidding. When he draws a card, he says &quot;Simon Says&quot;, and then makes a command. A black and white silhouette picture relating to the command appears on the card. For example, when he makes [[Alec Cataldi]] act like a duck with one of his cards, an image of a duck appears on the card. Simon Says then throws the card at the person, and it fades into their body, causing the person to do whatever he has commanded them to do. He can give a person more than one command, like making [[Adrien's bodyguard]] act like a gorilla with and then making him attack Cat Noir with a second card, or he can make multiple cards with the same command at once, like using a handful of cards to transform a group of people into mindless followers. Cards can also affect objects, as Simon Says creates a card that breaks Ladybug's [[yo-yo]]. He is also able to throw his cards like knives with incredible accuracy. It doesn't matter if the target can't hear him, as long as he gives a command, the person is controlled.

{{Quote|How do you like your Camembert?|Jean|&quot;[[Mr. Pigeon]]&quot;}}
'''Butler Jean''' is an employee at [[Le Grand Paris]]. In &quot;[[Despair Bear]]&quot;, after being fired by [[Chloé Bourgeois]], he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Despair Bear''', a [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]] who controls a small [[Mr. Cuddly|teddy bear]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3KfS2cnPew&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Jean is tall with short dark brown hair and pale green eyes. He also has a thin dark brown mustache.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a dark velvet navy dress coat with a black bow tie, and the sleeves each have two black buttons and a pale yellow line around them toward the armholes. Underneath the jacket is a white collared shirt with four visible black buttons. He also has black slacks and black dress shoes.

=== As Despair Bear ===
When akumatized, he is doll-sized. His eyes are glowing green, and his mustache is long and black, bending upward at the tips. A black tear-like mark is on his left cheek below his eye. He wears a black head cover that only leaves his face exposed, a black tunic has glowing green lines around his neck and on his chest. Additionally, he wears black leggings, a glowing green line around his left knee, and black gloves.

He controls Mr. Cuddly, which is dark purple with a white chest, white muzzle, white inner ears. It also has a black mouth, black nose, and glowing green eyes.

{{For2|more of Butler Jean's outfits and designs|Butler Jean/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:MP Offering cheese.jpeg|left|thumb|The butler serving Camembert to Cat Noir.]]
Jean is dignified, helpful, and quite polite. In &quot;[[Mr. Pigeon]]&quot;, when [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] needs a bathroom and Camembert, he assists him. At their request, he also tells [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and Cat Noir about the events with [[Chloé Bourgeois]] the previous day in &quot;[[Antibug]]&quot;. He is willing to pretend to be a super-villain to please Chloé and [[Sabrina Raincomprix]], and he is concerned for Sabrina after Chloé gets upset at her and ignores her. As seen in &quot;Despair Bear&quot;, he likes to encourage people's best traits. 

As Despair Bear, he is very strict in expectations on how people should act and he is vengeful towards Chloé for being a terrible person. He doesn't like losing, getting very angry and trying to attack Cat Noir despite being very tiny and unable to do damage without the bear.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Jean knows how to act professionally, and follow orders, and he has useful skills as a butler, serving others and keeping the hotel clean by sweeping.

=== As Despair Bear ===
Despair Bear controls an [[list of akumatized objects|akumatized]] [[Mr. Cuddly]] from the inside using strings and metal levers. The bear moves very quickly and it is able to crawl on walls.

The bear can latch onto humans' bodies (often their legs), which gives Despair Bear control of the mind of the human. When under his control, the person's eyes become green. Despair Bear uses the strings and levers to control the person, and he can talk through the person he is controlling. Once he is knocked off, unable to hold on, or willing to let go of the victim, the victim gains control of themselves but doesn't remember what happened during his control over them.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
As an employee for [[André Bourgeois]], Jean obeys his daughter Chloé's requests and commands, such as blocking a door to prevent [[Rose Lavillant|Princess Fragrance]]'s minions from following her and [[Prince Ali]]. He knows how much Chloé reveres Ladybug, even pretending to be a villain for whenever she and Sabrina play as Ladybug and Cat Noir respectively. However, he also gets to witness Chloé's awful behavior and mistreatment towards Sabrina. Aware of Chloé's nastier traits, he wants her to treat others better for her own sake and their sake. He worries about her relationship with Sabrina, and he suggests to no avail that Chloé should talk to her in &quot;Antibug&quot; when she is ignoring Sabrina's presence.

He encourages Chloé to be nicer by using [[Mr. Cuddly]] to remind her during the party, but he unintentionally embarrasses her because of it. He feels bad when she rejects his help, and while akumatized as Despair Bear, his intention is to punish her for her bad behavior. However, when he reverts back, he shows gratefulness towards her for letting him keep his job and he shows happiness that Chloé did a few good deeds.

=== [[Sabrina Raincomprix]] ===
Because he sees Chloé and Sabrina' interactions, Jean feels bad for Sabrina whenever she and Chloé get into arguments. He tries to vouch for Sabrina when Chloé is ignoring her, upset for Sabrina being shunned for an unintentional mistake, but it doesn't work.

== Trivia ==
* Jean's hair color and dress coat randomly change within &quot;Mr. Pigeon&quot;; he has his regular colors in the first shot featuring him in the elevator, but in the next shot, his hair is black, and when he lets Cat Noir into a room, his hair and coat are both black.
* In &quot;Antibug&quot;, Jean reveals that as part of one of Chloé's games with Sabrina, he was made to act out the part of the fictitious villain &quot;Big Mustachio.&quot; His outfit is the same while he's acting as Big Mustachio, but he additionally wears Groucho glasses.
** In the French dub, his fictitious villain name is &quot;Super Mustache.&quot;
* In &quot;[[Despair Bear]]&quot;, it is revealed that part of his first name is Jean and that [[Chloé Bourgeois]] can't remember the second half.
* Despair Bear is the only akumatized villain to become smaller when transformed and have a tiny size by default. Both [[Mylène Haprèle|Horrificator]] and [[Otis Césaire|Animan]] can become smaller, although smaller sizes are not their default forms. 
* Scarlet Despair Bear reappears in the two-part special event [[Heroes' Day]].

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an Italian photographer who does [[Adrien Agreste]]'s photo shoots. In &quot;[[Reflekta]]&quot;, he takes class photos of the students at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]]. 

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Vincent is a tall man with dark reddish-brown hair, pale orange-brown eyes and a soul patch.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a white t-shirt with a v-neck, red and green plaid pants with light gray suspenders, light gray work boots, and fingerless leather gloves with holes exposing his knuckles.

{{For2|more of Vincent’s outfits and designs|Vincent/Designs}}

== Personality ==
Vincent is a somewhat eccentric yet passionate man about his job, always changing his pose during photo shoots and asking [[Adrien Agreste]] to imagine strange ideas (for instance, his [[Emilie Agreste|mother]] bringing him spaghetti and then she drops it and he needs to eat it off the ground) in order to express specific emotions for the photos. He also dislikes being interrupted while he's doing his job. In &quot;[[Reflekta]]&quot;, Vincent shows that he's capable of standing his ground, refusing to give in to [[Chloé Bourgeois]]'s demands to be placed next to Adrien for the class photo, even when she threatens to involve [[André Bourgeois|her father]], and instead asking her if her father was a photographer.

'''Xavier-Yves Roth''', better known as '''{{PAGENAME}}''', is a famous pop star and [[Jagged Stone]]'s biggest rival in the music making business. He is [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]]'s favorite singer, as stated in &quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot;. His father is the producer [[Bob Roth]].

== Appearance ==

=== Physical appearance ===
XY is tall with light skin, blond hair styled to stick forward, and blue eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a purple camouflage headband that is tied in the back of his head. His jacket is purple, having white with a thin black line in the middle cuffs, bottom, and collar, and he wears it over a white t-shirt with a low collar. He wears a light purple belt with a golden buckle, pale blue jeans, and gray tennis shoes. He also wears a gold chain necklace with a large gold &quot;XY&quot; symbol hanging from it.

== Personality ==
XY is arrogant, vain, and rude, believing himself to be the best and looking down at anyone who isn't as popular as him. He carelessly insults his rivals in the music industry, and he doesn't take warnings seriously, even when they come from the superheroes [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]]. When his life is being threatened, though, he freaks out and loses his overconfident nature. He is also lazy as he does not even try to do anything original or work related, believing its easier to let someone do all the work then take the credit.

== Abilities ==
He is good at making music that people enjoy, as he has amassed considerable fame. However, this is questionable, considering he planned to have a music engineer and hologram of himself to play a supposedly live concert. 
It is revealed in &quot;Silencer&quot; that he doesn't actually make much of his music but instead he copies it from inspiration.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Jagged Stone]] ===

[[File:GV (699).png|thumb|XY (right) meets Guitar Villain.]]XY doesn't like Jagged very much, thinking that he is too &quot;old-fashioned&quot; to perform. However, when he as Guitar Villain comes to get revenge on him for insulting him during a TV interview, XY panics and pleads with him to spare his life.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] &amp; [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] ===
[[File:GV_(678).png|thumb|left|180px|XY meets Ladybug and Cat Noir]]
When Ladybug and Cat Noir come to warn XY about Guitar Villain, XY does not take their warning seriously and ignores it until it is too late.

== Trivia ==
[[File:GV (169).png|thumb|XY's #1 album cover that [[Bob Roth]] wanted [[Jagged Stone]] to use.]]
* In the Serbian dub, Jagged and XY are voiced by the same voice actor, Mateja Vukašinović.
* His name is a reference to the musician [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Z Jay Z]. &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/740489670652497921&lt;/ref&gt;
* XY is very popular, being at #1 on the sales chart.
** Because of this, [[Bob Roth]] wants to base the cover of Jagged Stone's upcoming [[Rock Giant|album]] after XY's album, ''[[Number One]]'', and his promotional artwork.
** However, when Jagged Stone releases his album &quot;Rock Giant,&quot; he overthrows XY as #1 in sales.
* XY can be seen as a caricature of Justin Bieber in his early career, especially with his purple color scheme, youthful facial features (Jagged refers to him as a &quot;baby&quot;), rude tendencies, and repetitive yet catchy pop tunes.
* He is [[Chloé Bourgeois/Gallery|Chloé's]] favorite musician.
** Speaking of Chloé, XY seems to be her male counterpart, as both were arrogant and vain people who think highly of themselves and lowly of others as of the first season. But Chloé, unlike XY, is shown to gradually redeem herself and be more good and likable, while XY is still arrogant and rude. 
* His music mainly consists of beats and techno music rather than consisting of lyrics.
* In &quot;[[Captain Hardrock]]&quot;, he can be seen at the [[Place de la Concorde]] and he has been setting his concert there.
* In &quot;[[Silencer]]&quot;, it is revealed that his actual name is Xavier-Yves.

{{Quote|Bottom line is that Bob Roth Records cannot afford to be #2 in sales or rep. a #2 rock star!|Bob|&quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot;|quotelink=yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;http://avatartagg.tumblr.com/post/140141862658/ta-bob-roth-is-jss-producer-penny-rolling-is&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Jagged Stone]]'s producer and the owner of Bob Roth Records. He is also the father of singer [[XY]].

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Bob is tall with light gray receding hair, a gray mustache, tan skin, and yellow-green eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears white dress pants and a white suit jacket over a pink shirt with gray buttons. His dress shoes are brown with silver tips. He also wears yellow-green sunglasses with black rims on his head, a thick gold necklace around his neck, and a gold ring with a red spot on the middle finger on his right hand.

== Personality ==
Bob is bossy and greedy, only caring about money, as shown in &quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot; when he asks Jagged Stone to change his style to match that of [[XY]], in order to sell more albums. He'll be dishonest in order to get his way, lying to [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] when he asks her to create Jagged Stone's new album cover, which Jagged Stone requested, and tells her to base it off of the previous cover test design that is similar to the style of XY's promotional artwork. However, while begrudgingly, he does back down if he is threatened, not wanting to lose Jagged Stone's sales or deal with the wrath of his pet crocodile, [[Fang]].

In &quot;Silencer&quot;, he is shown to be cowardly hiding behind Marinette when being threatened by the titular villain or when he used Ladybug as a shield to defend himself against Silencer at the cost of the heroine losing her voice. His dishonesty also continues when he refuses to admit that he stole everything from [[Kitty Section]] and isn't afraid to blackmail others to get them out of his way, meaning that he is also pushy and forceful towards others to do their job like with Ladybug. Once out of danger, he is also boastful which led to him carelessly revealing the truth on live television.

Also in the aforementioned episode, he is a father who spoils his son [[XY]] whom he indulges and has never taught XY any morals or ethics as he always allows his son to steal other singers' ideas.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Jagged Stone]] ===
[[File:GV_(74).png|thumb|left|Bob argues with Jagged.]]Though Bob is Jagged Stone's producer, the two do not get along very well. Bob is always trying to pressure him into changing his style into something more &quot;modern&quot; like XY, something Jagged is completely against. He also threatens to drop Jagged from his record label if his album doesn't hit #1 on the charts.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] ===
[[File:GV_(142).png|thumb|Bob tells Marinette to design Jagged's album cover like XY's]]Bob first encounters Marinette in &quot;Guitar Villain&quot; when he offers her a chance to design Jagged Stone's new album cover, though he lies to her and says that Jagged is changing his style in order to ensure that she makes an album cover like XY's. In &quot;Troublemaker&quot;, he is fine with filming Jagged Stone in her parents' bakery. However, in &quot;Silencer&quot;, he has no qualms about stealing her costume ideas for XY. When Marinette confronts him about this and decides to tell the truth on live TV, Bob threatens to ruin her reputation if she does so, reminding her that people wouldn't believe her anyway.

=== [[XY]] ===
[[File:GV_(22).png|thumb|left|Bob tells Jagged to change his style into XY's]]Bob is fond of XY's style and constantly tries to encourage Jagged to change his style to be more like his.

In &quot;Silencer&quot;, it is revealed that Bob is XY's father. The two get along quite well as they both are fond of stealing others' ideas to achieve success. This connotes that he doesn’t teach his son anything about morals and ethics in entertainment business.

=== [[Luka Couffaine]] ===
When Luka, along with Marinette, confronts Bob about him stealing Kitty Section's idea, Bob dismisses his claims and threatens Marinette in front of him, angering him so much that he gets akumatized.

{{Quote|Bob, Jagged and I had an idea. Its concept is modern, but it respects Jagged's own... rugged style.|Penny|&quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot;}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;http://avatartagg.tumblr.com/post/140141862658/ta-bob-roth-is-jss-producer-penny-rolling-is&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Jagged Stone]]'s agent.

In &quot;[[Troublemaker]]&quot;, due to the pressure put on her by Jagged Stone, [[Alec Cataldi]], [[Bob Roth]] and [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] from filming a TV show, Penny is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Troublemaker''', an intangible [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Penny is a slender dark-skinned woman with pixie-cut purple hair and light brown eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
She wears a black jacket with a silver buckle and zipper over a white t-shirt with a v-neck, black pants, and black shoes. She also wears a silver necklace with a green skull pendant, one sphere-shaped earring on her right ear, and wristbands: a red band on her left wrist, and black and pink bands on her right wrist.

=== As Troublemaker ===
Troublemaker has light gray skin and her hair is spiked upward like a mohawk with light gray tips. The areas around her eyes are black, and her lips are dark purple. A dark purple choker with silver spikes is around her neck, and she wears a dark purple vest with ripped sleeves and edges. Underneath, she has a black sleeveless jumpsuit with platform shoes and pink sections with jagged white outlines on the sides of her legs and hips. On her arms are black and pink cuffs with white edges. On the chest of her jumpsuit, there is a logo of a silver skull over four diagonal pink spikes.

== Personality ==
[[File:PX (235).png|left|thumb|Penny requesting a pair of sunglasses for Jagged Stone.]]
Penny is a very professional, helpful and hardworking person who is also kind, thoughtful and supportive. She helps to solve problems, usually disagreements between two sides, by looking over everything carefully and trying to find a middle point or compromise that satisfies everyone. She gives encouragement to [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]], finds amusement in a misunderstanding that [[André Bourgeois]] has relating to her, and she puts on a good face with dealing with business partners, acquaintances, and teenagers. While usually nice, Penny takes on a serious, curt, or confrontational demeanor depending on the situation, like when she sternly demands to [[Vincent Aza]] that he stops bothering and taking photos of Jagged Stone in &quot;[[Pixelator]]&quot;.

As Troublemaker, Penny is mischievous, conniving and sneaky. She's also a bit of a showboat, making a great deal out of achieving one earring from Ladybug. She's also short-tempered, angry with losing Ladybug's earring quickly after achieving it, and with Ladybug's plan to stop her.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Penny is skilled in business communication, cooperating professionally and strategically with the people she works for. She represents Jagged Stone by finding ways to fulfill his desires, but she also knows how to deal with the interactions between Jagged and his manager [[Bob Roth]].

=== As Troublemaker ===
Troublemaker can switch between being intangible and tangible by clicking her pen but she can't make objects untangible. She can only attack while in her solid form.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Jagged Stone]] ===
[[File:GV (89).png|thumb|Penny giving a suggestion about Marinette designing the album cover while satisfying Bob.]]
Penny has a strong dedication to Jagged Stone as his agent. While aware of his eccentricities and stubbornness, she patiently works with him and helps to get him what he needs. She also understands his desire to be authentic to himself and his interests, but she makes sure to think about the business side of issues when he isn't as willing to think about it.

In &quot;Troublemaker&quot;, Penny shows that she has romantic feelings for Jagged as she wants to make him happy and considers him as an &quot;awesome&quot; person. 

=== [[Bob Roth]] ===
Penny is more respectful to Bob than Jagged is, but she does her best to remind him of the artistic side of issues, including Jagged's style and decisions. She starts the discussion on asking Marinette to design Jagged Stone's [[Rock Giant|album]] cover in &quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot;, pointing out the design will be modern and it will be created by someone in Jagged's target audience in order to get Bob to comply. It's because of her intervention and professionalism that she keeps Bob and Jagged working together at Bob Roth Records, despite the two men not getting along well with each other.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] ===
[[File:GV (254).png|left|thumb|Penny caringly telling Marinette to do her best on the album cover.]]
When Marinette gives Penny the pair of [[Jagged Stone's glasses|shades]] she made for Jagged to give to him for her, Penny takes them and closes the door before Marinette can thank her. However, Penny treats Marinette better with more friendliness in subsequent meetings, smiling politely when giving Marinette a ticket to Jagged Stone's concert. In &quot;Guitar Villain&quot;, she encourages Marinette to do her best when she is designing a cover for Jagged's [[Rock Giant|album]] and Marinette's final design pleases her. 

=== [[Vincent Aza]] ===
[[File:PX (176).png|thumb|Penny warning Vincent and preparing to toss his camera to him.]]
Penny finds Vincent and his obsession with Jagged Stone greatly annoying and troublesome. In &quot;[[Pixelator]]&quot;, when Vincent is caught trying to take photos of Jagged at [[Le Grand Paris]], without any hint of remorse, she angrily makes him get out of the hotel's lobby and threatens to break his camera if she ever finds him around Jagged again. While not recognizing the titular villain being Vincent, Penny appears annoyed when he knocks on the door to Jagged Stone's suite, suspiciously asking who he is before he pixelates her.

== Trivia ==
* Penny's last name and Jagged's last name are a reference to the rock band [[Wikipedia:The Rolling Stones|The Rolling Stones]].
* In &quot;[[Pixelator]]&quot;, [[André Bourgeois]] confuses her name with [[Fang|Jagged Stone's pet crocodile]], which causes Penny to be genuinely amused by his mix-up.

== Personality  ==
[[File:RC S01EP09 (23).png|left|thumb|Adrien calling his father, upset that he hasn't shown up for Career Day.]]
Adrien is a charismatic, but shy, a bit reserved, and slightly innocent young boy — partially due to his unfamiliarity to much of the world beyond his father's reach.&lt;ref&gt;Report on Thomas Astruc at Japan Weekend: https://twitter.com/Ladybug_Cartoon/status/780062958751809536&lt;/ref&gt; While liking to have fun, he is more serious, obedient, somewhat insecure, and less lively due to his strict upbringing. Wanting to change, make friends, and experience new things is one of his main motives to complement himself, but it's a bit of a struggle for Adrien and it worries him every now and then. He usually thinks reasonably and will express annoyance and frustration when someone is being difficult or something is going wrong. If something makes him sad, he tries to downplay his feelings on it, like his relationship with his [[Gabriel Agreste|father]], but he will act on impulse if he is emotional enough, like lying to [[Théo Barbot]] out of jealousy about his relationship with Ladybug and going out into the night while unhappy on Christmas in &quot;[[Santa Claws]]&quot;.

[[File:OR-2_(232).png|thumb|Adrien introduces himself to Nino.]]

Even though he is not very openly emotional or affectionate to most people, Adrien is friendly, empathetic, and encouraging to others in hard times and he also has an easier time letting his feelings show to those whom he is close to. Adrien can be reckless, as seen in &quot;[[Riposte]]&quot;, when he insists on fighting an [[Akumatized villains|akumatized villain]] with a sprained ankle, but is dedicated to his duty as a superhero and protective towards Ladybug with or without the mask. That recklessness is shown again in &quot;Miraculer&quot;, when he had his ribs broken as a result of his Cataclysm being used against him and on the verge of dying but still fought anyway. On Instagram, it is mentioned that he was tempted to slide down the bannisters.

In some instances, he has acted rebelliously, like going places without informing anyone or taking things that don't belong to him. Doing things he's not suppose to when his parents aren't around. Also, his desire to be loved makes him vulnerable whenever disappointed. He is displeased with Ladybug for not showing up to a date he asked her on in &quot;[[Glaciator]]&quot;, though she warned him she had previous plans, but he apologizes for overreacting when he realizes that she feels bad about it.

[[File:SS (161).png|thumb|left|Adrien fistbumps with Nino after he wins &quot;The Challenge&quot;.]]
He is caring and supportive towards his family and friends as seen in &quot;Simon Says&quot;, where Adrien supported [[Nino Lahiffe]] during The Challenge, and again in &quot;Animan&quot; where he supported Nino's crush on [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]]. Despite Adrien's distant relationship with his father, he tries to be there for him, which he mentions in &quot;Adrien's Double Life&quot;. He was supportive of Marinette on several occasions, praising her for her amazing artwork and winning the contest in &quot;Mr. Pigeon.&quot; Also, in &quot;Troublemaker&quot; he watched the show &quot;''Fill My Shoes''&quot;, being filmed at Marinette's house and checked on her afterwards at school. In &quot;Style Queen&quot; and &quot;Queen Wasp&quot;, where he encouraged her to be proud of her derby hat design.

[[File:Syren (380).png|thumb|Adrien bribes Plagg into giving him information with cheese.]]
At times, Adrien can be persistent when wanting to figure something out, as seen in &quot;Syren&quot;, where he continuously bribed [[Plagg]] with cheese until he spilled the truth about what Ladybug was hiding from him. This trait is also highly apparent in his romantic pursuit of her, to the point where [[Kagami Tsurugi]] believes he's stubborn. Like [[Alya Césaire]], Adrien places extreme values on the mutual trust he has with Ladybug. In several episodes, while as himself Adrien is secretive to others about his love towards Ladybug, partially telling Kagami in &quot;Frozer&quot; and Marinette in &quot;The Puppeteer 2&quot;.

Like how he extremely values Ladybug's trust, he also values his friendship with Marinette with her being the first real friend he made on his own, not wanting to lose it, as well as becoming hurt at the thought of her hating him again and wanted to cheer her up but was happy that she didn't hate him.

Sometimes, Adrien can act nervous or surprised in awkward situations or doing awkward things as seen in &quot;Guitar Villain,&quot; when he nervously asked Marinette to sign his copy of [[Jagged Stone]]'s [[Rock Giant|new album]] and &quot;[[Gorizilla]]&quot;, when he came across Wayhem. This is also shown in &quot;[[Frightningale]],&quot; when he and Marinette posed as their alter-egos in [[Clara Nightingale]]'s music video. Adrien also displayed insecurity in &quot;[[Frozer]]&quot;, where he was shy about going to the ice rink alone with Kagami. During &quot;The Puppeteer 2&quot;, under the fear that Marinette may hate him, Adrien tried to make her more comfortable around him but froze up instead admitting that he oblivious of things at times believing he did something to mess up their friendship (when in reality it was another one of Alya's plans to get them together.) 

{{HideSpoiler|Adrien displayed his biggest sense of insecurity when he failed to save those he cares about or loves like Ladybug in &quot;Desperada&quot;. Right up to the point of where he was unsure of what to do anymore.}}

[[File:FN (430).png|thumb|left|Adrien acts awkwardly in his Cat Noir costume.]]
He is also shown to be understanding towards others on several occasions such as in &quot;Troublemaker&quot;, when Adrien told Marinette that he's gotten used to having a lot of fans and photos of him everywhere even in the most unlikely places. In &quot;Sandboy&quot;, when Plagg sneaked out without telling him. In &quot;Queen Wasp&quot;, after [[Chloé Bourgeois]] was de-akumatized, he told her that he knew that she did what she did to impress her mother.

Through his time as Cat Noir and like Marinette, Adrien to has grown in confidence seen in &quot;Simon Says&quot; when he stood up to his father. In &quot;Gorizilla&quot;, where he tried to him for a favor and attempted in &quot;Frozer&quot;. In &quot;The Puppeteer 2&quot;, when he asked Nathalie if he could bring his friends with him to the wax museum.

{{HideSpoiler|Also asking his father if he could spend time with his friends in &quot;Stormy Weather 2&quot;.}}

[[File:PH S01EP06 (487).png|thumb|Cat Noir taunting mummies while on a lamppost.]]
As Cat Noir, Adrien has the freedom to act however he wants outside of his normal life, letting his wilder side come out, and becoming cocky and outgoing.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;Report on Thomas Astruc at Japan Weekend: https://twitter.com/Ladybug_Cartoon/status/780070765798559745&lt;/ref&gt; More optimistic and open, he says whatever comes to his mind and makes plenty of typically cat-related jokes and puns. In his attempts to get Ladybug's attention, along with other people, he brags and boasts about himself in a comedic way.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;[[:File:LadyBug 'Making of'|LadyBug 'Making of']]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Cat Noir's exaggerated personality, especially his flirting with Ladybug, stems from entertainment such as anime, television, and movies due to his lack of experience with people his age beyond Chloé.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

[[File:OR-2 (563).png|thumb|left|Cat Noir is shocked and concerned by Hawk Moth’s message.]]
Adrien's change to his superhero status doesn't diminish his kindness and concern for others though, among many of his other personality traits, such as his reasonable character and deep loyalty. On certain occasions, as Cat Noir he can be hasty sometimes, such as when rushing to face Stormy Weather without a plan. Due to this rashness, in several episodes Cat Noir sometimes needs to be restrained or stopped by Ladybug or Master Fu. While more prone to goofing off, Cat Noir gets serious when needed, especially when fighting an [[Akumatized villains|akumatized villain]]. It is rare for him to reveal his vulnerable side, but it does come through at times, as when he quietly comments that not all parents are loving in &quot;[[The Bubbler]],&quot; and tries in vain to tell Ladybug about his love for her before their transformations wore off in &quot;[[Dark Cupid]]&quot;. Determined to help others and save the day, Cat Noir really cherishes being uninhibited by his civilian life as a superhero.

[[File:Sapotis-000711.png|thumb|Cat Noir happily welcomes Rena Rouge into the team.]]
He also understands that it takes more than just superpowers to be a hero or useful, as seen in &quot;Reflekta&quot;; despite the fact that his powers were gone, with his quick thinking he was able to help Ladybug out of a tight spot. Cat Noir is also welcoming and friendly when it comes to accepting new additions to the team, having open arms for [[Lila Rossi|Lila]] in &quot;[[Volpina]]&quot; and [[Alya Césaire|Rena Rouge]] in &quot;[[Sapotis]]&quot;. In &quot;Reverser&quot;, Cat Noir is also open to accepting help from others like Alix and Nathaniel, as at the time he was reversed to being a complete coward.

According to [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] in &quot;Copycat&quot;, Cat Noir does annoy her a lot, but he has never lied to her, meaning that he is honest. As well as in &quot;Cat Noir as seen by Marinette&quot;, she also describes him as cocky, nosy and a show off. Also as Cat Noir, Adrien has the people's loyalty, respect, trust, and help when he needs it, as shown in &quot;[[Reflekta]]&quot;, &quot;[[Gorizilla]]&quot; and in &quot;Heroes' Day&quot;. According to him in &quot;Plagg&quot;, being Cat Noir is the only time Adrien can be himself. But as Cat Noir, he is more expressive about his love towards Ladybug.

As Cat Noir, Adrien still keeps his encouraging side picking others up when they're feeling down, in doubt or not being honest. Such as Ladybug when she was down about failing the first time in &quot;Origins&quot; or when she expressed uncertainty about defeating Hawk Moth in &quot;Heroes' Day&quot;. Chloe in &quot;Queen Wasp&quot;, where he encouraged her to return the Bee Miraculous as well as with Lila in &quot;Chameleon&quot;, when Adrien encouraged her to be honest with others. Like Ladybug, he is good at giving advice to others when they need seen in &quot;Gamer 2.0&quot; and &quot;The Puppeteer 2&quot;. 

When Ladybug is out of commission Cat Noir acts as temporary leader until she returns seen in &quot;Party Crasher&quot;.

{{HideSpoiler|As Mister Bug, Adrien retains most of his personality as Cat Noir like his hastyness and his confidence in his abilities. However, according to Lady Noir, he has lost his sense of humor, getting a taste of Ladybug's seriousness and creative thinking.

As Aspik, Adrien retains more of his personality as a civilian, than as Cat Noir. However, despite being still trustworthy and faithful, his crush on Ladybug prevents him from doing a good job on fighting Desperada. On a desperate move to impress her as Adrien, he disregards the villains's movements and keeps using his power to get back in time to try to prevent Ladybug from being captured. Eventually, he comes to conclusion he cannot be of any help to her as Aspik and returns the Snake Miraculous to Ladybug.}}

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
[[File:CC (90).png|left|thumb|Adrien defeats his fencing opponent.]]
In addition to being a fashion model and home-schooled, Adrien takes basketball, fencing, piano, and Chinese lessons.&lt;ref&gt;As seen on his [[Adrien's schedule|schedule]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he is able to speak Chinese fluently and is able to communicate with [[Wang Cheng]] as seen in [[Kung Food]]. He is also quite good at video games, being able to beat [[Max Kanté]] in [[Ultimate Mecha Strike III|''Ultimate Mecha Strike III'']] and achieve one of the top scores in the entire school. Adrien, as Cat Noir, shows that he understands Morse code in “[[Robostus]]&quot;. In &quot;Sapotis,&quot; it is revealed that he knows ''Kung Fu''. In &quot;[[Animaestro]]&quot;, it is revealed that Adrien can speak fluent Japanese.

[[File:DB S01EP12 (632).png|thumb|Cat Noir battles Darkblade.]]
As Cat Noir, Adrien is able to fight on equal grounds with [[Armand D'Argencourt|Darkblade]] and fend off his knights effortlessly, showing great skill for offensive and defensive movements. Other than fencing, he also does ''Karate'', as revealed in &quot;[[Simon Says]]&quot;, which enables him to fight in hand-to-hand combat as well with his [[Adrien's bodyguard|bodyguard]].

=== As Cat Noir ===
[[File:Syren (174).png|thumb|left|Cat Noir runs from panthers.]]
Cat Noir has enhanced skills such as speed, agility, strength and near-invulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/660372597926993920&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[Syren]]&quot;, he manages to outrun a pair of panthers meaning he is capable of running at least between 35-50 mph. Like a cat, he also has enhanced senses such as hearing, smell, night vision, and has super stealth.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/AzuraJae/status/654711775401631744&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CH (760).png|thumb|Cat Noir uses his claws on Captain Hardrock’s ship.]]
Also like a cat, he can use his claws to climb up surfaces seen in &quot;Dark Cupid&quot; and several other episodes. As well as use them to cut through things like how he attempted to cut the sails in Captain Hardrock's ship. Cat Noir uses his [[staff]] efficiently, wielding it as a sword, throwing it with great precision and having it be deflected back to him, being able to spin it at high speeds to form a shield, and taking advantage of its duplication and length-changing features. To travel long distances, he uses his staff and its variety in length to vault over obstacles. He also has good hand-to-hand combat skills when needed.

In and out of &quot;Aqua Mode&quot;, he can also use his staff as a breathing apparatus for those who can't breathe underwater like himself in &quot;Reverser&quot; and &quot;Queen Wasp&quot; and [[Ondine]] in &quot;Mayura&quot;. Even out of &quot;Aqua Mode&quot; Cat Noir is a good swimmer.

[[File:Cataclysm (14).png|thumb|left|Cat Noir calls on his Cataclysm.]]
His special power, [[Cataclysm]], allows him to negatively affect anything that he touches with his ring hand. While it is usually used to destroy objects, it can be used for a variety of different effects, like causing a bus' controls to go haywire or creating a platform in a structure. However, using Cataclysm drains his Miraculous' power, causing him to revert back to Adrien typically five minutes afterwards, so he has to use it wisely.

==== Aqua Form ====
When accessing his aqua powers, Cat Noir has the ability to breathe underwater and enhanced swimming capabilities.

==== Ice Form ====
When accessing his ice powers, with his ice skates Cat Noir has the ability to move quickly and freely on the ice.

{{HideSpoiler|
==== As Mister Bug ====
[[File:Mister_bug.jpg|thumb|Adrien transforming into Mister Bug while as Reflekta.]]
He has the same abilities as his partner Ladybug such as more enhanced skills; like speed, agility, and strength that he is almost invulnerable to physical damage. Similar to a real ladybug, he can climb up surfaces without his yo-yo.

Along with his special power, Lucky Charm, helps him by summoning an object that he uses to achieve his objective, it often being to stop a villain. Though usually confused at first, his creativity and cleverness help enable him to perceive where the object can be used to help his achieve his goal, thinking up ideas and plans on his own. However, Lucky Charm drains his power and causing him to revert back to Adrien shortly afterward, so he has to use it wisely. Once the villain is dealt with, Mister Bug can throw his Lucky Charm object into the air and use the Miraculous Ladybug, which will make it revert back to energy and fix all of the damage done since the villain was created.

Like Ladybug, he too can wield his yo-yo remarkably well, like using it as a grappling hook, a rope to restrain others, a projectile, and even a shield if he spins it fast enough. After an evil akuma is released from its corrupted object, he can open his yo-yo, throw it to grab it, and remove the energy-charged it with, releasing it as a normal butterfly. His yo-yo can also work as a breathing apparatus for those who can't breathe underwater like himself.

=== As Aspik ===
Like Viperion, Aspik has much more enhanced skills, such as speed, agility, and strength, and he is almost invulnerable to physical damage. Like a snake, he also has enhanced senses like hearing and smell as well as infrared vision and possibly the ability to feel vibrations but it is yet to be seen.

Second Chance (Aspik's special power) allows him to reverse time and change the outcome of an event, in which the power activates by sliding his finger on his Miraculous.

== Trivia ==
* The character of Adrien was created around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/thomas_astruc/status/674697032121061376&lt;/ref&gt;
* The French name &quot;Adrien&quot; comes from the Roman cognomen &quot;Hadrianus,&quot; which means &quot;from Hadria.&quot; In the days of the Roman Empire, Hadria was a town in northern Italy and the namesake of the Adriatic Sea. The Adriatic Sea is known for the dark-colored sand on its beaches, and for this reason, the name is also commonly translated as &quot;dark one.&quot;
** His last name, &quot;Agreste,&quot; means &quot;rural&quot; in French. It is also the French name for the [[wikipedia:Grayling (butterfly)|grayling butterfly]]. Hence, his full name may be taken as meaning &quot;dark butterfly&quot;.
** Jokingly, [[Thomas Astruc]] said that his middle name is &quot;Perfection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/870801677229666304&lt;/ref&gt;
* The name &quot;Chat Noir&quot; is French for &quot;Black Cat.&quot; Some sources have called him &quot;Black Cat&quot; instead of Chat Noir or Cat Noir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/worldscreen/docs/tv_kids_mipcom_2013 MIPCOM 2013 coverage page 59/142]&lt;/ref&gt;
** In the Korean, Hebrew and Serbian versions, Adrien's superhero name is &quot;Black Cat.&quot;
** In the Russian version, Adrien's superhero name is &quot;Super Cat.&quot;
* The earliest known appearance of Cat Noir was on the [[:File:Issue 12.png|fake cover]] of Issue #12 of ''The Mini Menace Ladybug''.
* In Polish, the pronunciation of Adrien's surname &quot;Agreste&quot; means gooseberry
* Fans originally called him Félix, after a [[wikipedia:Felix the Cat|famous cartoon cat]]. For some time, this name appeared on the original French version of Zagtoon's official website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://miraculousladybug.freeforums.net/index.cgi?board=news&amp;action=display&amp;thread=47 Felix seen on Zagtoon's site]&lt;/ref&gt; but later disappeared with newer, equally reliable sources calling him &quot;Adrien.&quot;
** It was later revealed that the Ladybug PV version had in fact been called &quot;[[Félix Agreste|Félix]],&quot; and Félix and Adrien are not the same character. Adrien was made around 2012 to replace Félix.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/674697032121061376&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PV HQ (4).png|thumb|Félix, the previous version of Cat Noir, with Marinette in the Ladybug PV.]]
* Adrien's appearance changed immensely from Félix's design (seen in the Ladybug PV) to his own design. Félix's design included more formal clothing with black and gray colors, desaturated green eyes, and a tidier hairstyle. As Cat Noir, Félix wears higher boots and doesn't have a staff for a weapon.
** Their personalities are also different. Félix is less social, not openly friendly, and unkind to Marinette.
** Unlike Félix, Adrien's ring can come off anytime. This is seen in &quot;Lady Wifi&quot; when he, as Cat Noir, gets locked into a freezer and the impact causes his ring to fall off his finger, which makes him revert back to normal.
* Because Félix was Cat Noir in the Ladybug PV, Adrien was never seen in 2D form until the ''Miraculous: Tales from Paris'' webisodes. He will be seen again in 2D in the Miraculous Ladybug OVA, as Adrien is confirmed to still be Cat Noir instead of Félix.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/679310947933102080&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cat Noir's legacy is as old as ancient China, as revealed in &quot;Volpina&quot;.
* His responsibilities as a superhero not only include fighting akumatized villains, but also patrolling among many other things.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/660792250310524928&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is shown in &quot;Mr. Pigeon&quot; that Adrien is allergic to feathers and also that he can whistle.
* In the French version of &quot;Copycat&quot;, Cat Noir calls Ladybug &quot;Buginette&quot; (in French, adding &quot;-nette&quot; to the end of a word is a way of showing affection). In the English version, he calls her &quot;Bugaboo.&quot;
** In the French and Korean versions of &quot;The Evillustrator&quot;, Adrien as Cat Noir called Marinette &quot;Princess&quot;. In the English version, he calls her &quot;little lady&quot;.
* Adrien watches anime.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/680323684561715201&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to [[Keith Silverstein|Gabriel Agreste's voice actor]], Adrien is not allowed to play ''Pokémon Go''.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MoonieBalloonie/status/756963609532432384&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adrien doesn't appear to have as many issues juggling his normal life with his superhero work as Marinette does. However, he does struggle on occasion, as seen in &quot;Princess Fragrance&quot; when he misses his chemistry class. 
** This is also seen in &quot;Simon Says&quot; and &quot;Gorizilla&quot;, where he had to be in two places.
** In &quot;Backwarder&quot;, where he had to hurry back to the train before his father noticed he was gone.
* He mentions in &quot;The Pharaoh&quot;, &quot;Lady Wifi&quot;, and &quot;Ladybug as seen by Adrien&quot; that he suspects he might know Ladybug in normal life without realizing it.
* In &quot;Copycat&quot;, Adrien's phone number is shown to be +33635124.
* As he says in &quot;Dark Cupid&quot;, he hates signing autographs.
* As he says in &quot;Pixelator&quot;, he got to go to his first concert.
* According to Thomas Astruc in a joking matter, Cat Noir's suit is made of &quot;boyfriend material&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/thomas_astruc/status/667592702557597696&lt;/ref&gt;
** The suit is not made of leather but it is the closest material.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/665267709043679232&lt;/ref&gt;
** The ears are made of the same material as the rest of the suit.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/657147376709312513&lt;/ref&gt;
*** With that it could be possible that the suit is made of artificial leather or of an alternative for leather.
** The bell functions as a zipper and was added &quot;because it looks cute.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;This was answered on Tumblr before Thomas deactivated his account, ergo, no link. Admin Princess of Harte asked the question about the bell.&lt;/ref&gt;
*** The bell on Cat Noir's suit is a reference to a domestic kitten, conveying his inner desire for a loving home.
* Cat Noir's cat ears and tail are clearly fake. However, they respond to his mood and enhanced senses.
** [[Alya Césaire|Rena Rouge's]] ears and tail are also fake.
** During &quot;Dark Cupid&quot;, when Cat Noir isn't able to confess to Ladybug because their transformations are about to run out, his ears move down.
** In &quot;[[Animan]]&quot;, his cat ears move when he hears [[Otis Césaire|Animan]] coming.
** Again in &quot;[[Troublemaker]]&quot;, where he heard the villain's incoming attack.
* Cat Noir has also done other catlike actions, Ladybug scratching his chin in &quot;Animan&quot;, cleaning himself by licking water off in &quot;Princess Fragrance&quot;, purring in &quot;Prime Queen&quot;, growling at the villain, Audrey petting and cuddling him, licking his paw and chasing the toilet paper roll and the light of Ladybug's laser pointer, playing with Audrey's necklace and taking naps in &quot;[[Malediktator]]&quot;, he also caressed his tail after Ladybug pulled it in &quot;[[Stormy Weather]]&quot; and in other episodes he runs on all fours like a cat.
* According to Gabriel, he's a lot like his mother, both physically and in terms of personality.
* He's been turned evil several times so far, having fallen under the influence of [[Lê Chiến Kim|Dark Cupid]]'s hate arrows, ending up under the control of [[Manon Chamack|The Puppeteer]], being affected by [[Rose Lavillant|Princess Fragrance]]'s perfume, becoming controlled by [[Butler Jean|Despair Bear]], then being affected by [[Caline Bustier|Zombizou]]'s kiss and lastly being affected by Malediktator's declaration bubbles.
** Unlike the others, Malediktator didn't use Cat Noir to fight against Ladybug.
** As Cat Noir and himself, Adrien has been affected the most times by akumatized villains out of the French Miraculous superhero team with a total of 18 times. 
* The “Collector” reveals that Cat Noir’s tail is detachable.
* In &quot;[[Befana]]&quot;, Adrien reveals to Marinette that he always takes the bracelet she gave him everywhere he goes as a good lucky charm.
** According to him in his instagram page Adrien believes it's really lucky after he wins two fencing matches.
* During &quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot;, Adrien, as Cat Noir, reveals to Ladybug that he liked playing with cars when he was little.
* In &quot;[[Gorizilla]],&quot; Adrien's email address is revealed to be adrien@agreste.mode.
** Also according to Adrien, he says this is the first time he went to the theaters with a friend. 
* In &quot;[[Zombizou]],&quot; Adrien as Cat Noir tells Ladybug that he played a lot of car racing games.
* In &quot;[[Syren]]&quot;, it is revealed that Adrien has Ladybug and Cat Noir figurines.
** He also says he has always wanted a goldfish.
** As Cat Noir, Adrien was able to outrun a pair of panthers meaning he can run 35-50 mph, if he can run a top speed of 50 mph that means he's as fast as an adult lion.
* In &quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;, like himself, Adrien's greatest fear is being trapped alone, and as Cat Noir, his greatest fear is Ladybug hating him.
* During a Q &amp; A on January 15, 2019, [[Jeremy Zag]] confirmed [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and Cat Noir will reveal their identities and that it is already written.&lt;ref&gt;https://mobile.twitter.com/MiraculousINTL/status/1085274395109675008&lt;/ref&gt;
** Which is done in &quot;Oblivio&quot;. Although they were under the case of amnesia from the villain and had forgotten about the reveal once Ladybug restored everything with Miraculous Ladybug.
* As in &quot;Weredad&quot;, Adrien as Cat Noir reveals that this is the first time a girl admits being in love with him.
* According to Marinette and Chloé in &quot;Animaestro&quot;, Adrien enjoys passion fruit.
* In &quot;Oblivio&quot;, it is shown that Adrien keeps a photo album full of pictures of Ladybug in his phone.
** It is possible he took those pictures with his staff while transformed and when Ladybug wasn't looking and the photos transferred from his cat phone to his regular one.
* Adrien has his own official Instagram account. You can find him under nick [https://www.instagram.com/adrienagrestebrand/ @adrienagrestebrand].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/1152334692370309128&lt;/ref&gt;
** One of his instagram pictures Adrien mentions when having a break between photoshoots he likes to read classic novels.
** He also mentions in instagram when he was younger he had a fear of thunder.
** He says the park is one of his favorite places to do photoshoots. 
** He enjoys doing photoshoots as Cat Noir for civilians as well as hanging out with his other allies.&lt;ref&gt; @alya.ladyblogger&lt;/ref&gt;
* He does a proficient job at pretending to be a statue seen in &quot;[[The Puppeteer 2]]&quot;.
{{HideSpoiler|
* As of &quot;Cat Blanc&quot;, Adrien Agreste is the tenth person to become a Miraculous holder and an akumatized villain, excluding Gabriel Agreste who akumatized himself.
** He is the fourth member of the French Miraculous superhero team to become an akumatized hero following Queen Wasp, Rena Rage and Shell Shock.
* As of recent Season 3 spoilers, Adrien is the second person following Marinette for having the most Miraculous used on one person following the [[Cat Miraculous]], the [[Ladybug Miraculous]] and the [[Snake Miraculous]].
* He is also the second person following Marinette for having the most fusion forms with Snake Noir.
** However, except for his current Cat Noir form, his Mister Bug form in &quot;Reflekdoll,&quot; and his Aspik form in &quot;Desperada&quot;. Adrien's last future form is yet to be revealed.
* Mister Bug was first revealed in concept art shown at the 2018 Comic Con Experience panel on December 6, 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccxp18&quot;/&gt;
*Adrien is the second male to wield the Ladybug Miraculous as Mister Bug, contrasting to Marinette, who is the first female to wield the Cat Miraculous as Lady Noire.
* Aspik was first revealed in concept art shown at the 2018 Comic Con Experience panel on December 6, 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccxp18&quot;/&gt;
* Aspik's name is a version of ''aspic,'' the French word for &quot;asp,&quot; an archaic name for venomous snakes that inhabited the Nile region that is now believed to refer to the Egyptian cobra.}}

{{Wayzz Quote}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;http://avatartagg.tumblr.com/post/140270207743/me-earlier-what-is-the-right-spelling-for-the&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Kwamis|kwami]] of '''Protection''' who is connected to the [[Turtle Miraculous]], and with his power, its [[Miraculous holders|wearer]] can use the bracelet to transform into a turtle-themed superhero, the current wearer being [[Wang Fu|Master Wang Fu]]. Wayzz normally stays with Master Fu but he temporarily becomes loaned to Nino to help him transform into Carapace.

== Appearance ==
Wayzz is a small, light green creature that is 10 (or 4 inches) centimeters tall.&lt;ref&gt;Confirmed to [[User:BelieveInMagic814]] by the official [https://officialmiraculousladybug.tumblr.com/ Miraculous Ladybug Tumblr blog].&lt;/ref&gt; His appearance includes yellow sclerae, green eyes, and an antenna on his head. He also has a slightly darker green turtle shell on his back and a short pointed tail.

{{For2|more of Wayzz's designs|Wayzz/Designs}}

== Personality ==
Wayzz is kind, compassionate, and helpful. He worries when [[Miraculouses]] are being used incorrectly and Master Fu takes risks, but he trusts the wisdom of Master Fu, although concerned for the safety of his partner, the remaining Miraculous, and other Miraculous holders. He has a sense of humor, teasing [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] that she should have been given the kwami of lateness. He is also playful, happily running on a phonograph before getting stuck under it because of it being faster than him.

Wayzz can also be curious on occasion seen in &quot;[[Syren]]&quot; where he and Tikki begged Master Wang Fu to tell them the secret to modifying their powers and yet he was very understanding of what the consequences would be if he was captured with that knowledge. For the most part Wayzz is obedient towards Master Fu but he doesn't tell him everything at times seen in &quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;. As he didn't tell him the importance of tonight and apologized for his mistake.

== Abilities ==
Wayzz is able to fly, levitate, carry objects that are heavier than him and phase through solid objects. He can also sense the aura of a Miraculous, like when a Miraculous is being used for dark purposes, sensing that [[Nooroo]] and the [[Butterfly Miraculous]] are under [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]]'s control. He also appears to have a strong connection to other kwamis.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVLTu_WDlWE&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:OR1-(98).png|thumb|left|Master Fu attempting to transform.]]
As a kwami, Wayzz gives the wearer the power of protection and transforms them into a turtle-themed superhero by entering the Turtle Miraculous.

Whenever the wearer uses [[Shell-ter]], Wayzz begins losing power and eventually can't retain the transformation any longer, leaving the bracelet and reverting the wearer back to normal. To transform them again, he first needs to refuel by eating.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Wang Fu|Master Wang Fu]] ===
[[File:OR1-(107).png|thumb|right|Wayzz listening to Master Fu.]]
Wayzz is very loyal to his master, telling him immediately if he senses something wrong and, whether he fully agrees or not, trusting Master Fu's decisions. However, he thinks Master Fu is unreasonable for trying to transform at his age, which Master Fu disagrees on, and attempting to take care of Hawk Moth himself without other superheroes' assistance.

In spite of his obedience towards Master Fu, in &quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;, he didn't tell his owner about the importance of the night. When it ends with Hawk Moth almost finding the rest of the kwamis, he apologized to Master Fu for not telling him sooner but luckily he and the others were forgiven by the guardian.

He is also caring and considerate towards Master Fu in &quot;Backwarder&quot; when worried about his condition.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] ===
[[File:TC (54).png|thumb|left|Wayzz introduces himself to Marinette.]] When Master Fu chooses Marinette as the [[Ladybug Miraculous]] holder, Wayzz is unsure if she'll be up to the challenge. Though he hasn't met her, after she and Cat Noir successfully defeat [[Ivan Bruel|Stoneheart]], Wayzz compliments Master Fu on them being a great choice. In &quot;[[The Collector]]&quot;, Wayzz happily introduces himself to Marinette.

As seen in ''[[Miraculous Adventures]]'', Wayzz likes Marinette, and he eagerly and willingly explains the history of the kwamis to her with Master Fu and Tikki. When she has to leave because she is late for a hangout with her friends, Wayzz doesn't mind and finds it amusing as he teases her on her way out.

In &quot;[[Anansi]]&quot;, like [[Trixx]], Wayzz is trustful of Ladybug's judgement in picking Nino to wield his Miraculous.

Wayzz was surprised that Master Fu let Marinette be the new guardian of the Miracle Box after his passing in &quot;Backwarder&quot;.

=== [[Tikki]] ===
[[File:TC_(583).png|thumb|Tikki watches as Wayzz plays on the phonograph.]]
Wayzz gets along well with Tikki, both treating each other as friends. In &quot;[[The Collector]]&quot; they play with each other around the [[Fu's massage shop|room]] and on the phonograph, and in &quot;[[Robostus]]&quot;, they drink tea together on top of the phonograph.

They both share the same curiosity of modifying their powers in &quot;Syren&quot;. They shown that they work well together in &quot;Sandboy.&quot;

=== [[Adrien Agreste]] ===
Like with Marinette, Wayzz isn't certain if Adrien will be a good choice for wielding the [[Cat Miraculous]]. He accepts Adrien and Marinette as the right choices after the new superheroes save the day in &quot;[[Stoneheart (Origins - Part 2)|Stoneheart]]&quot;.

In &quot;[[Syren]]&quot;, Wayzz officially meets Adrien. He showed concern for Cat Noir in &quot;[[Malediktator]]&quot; when the villain turned him into an actual cat.

=== [[Nino Lahiffe]] ===
[[File:AS (571).png|thumb|left|Wayzz meets Nino.]] Wayzz meets Nino in &quot;[[Anansi]]&quot;, as it was his Miraculous' power that was needed to fight the umpteenth akuma. Following Nino's amused and intrigued reaction, not at all intimidated by the kwami's presence, Wayzz explains to him the instructions to turn him into a superhero, firmly sure of Ladybug's wise choice. In &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)|Catalyst]]&quot;, Wayzz has become closer with Nino by doing a special handshake the next time they meet and catching onto the way he talks.

As of &quot;Miraculer&quot; and &quot;Party Crasher&quot;, the two continue on working together in helping their allies against Hawk Moth.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
Despite not meeting Chloé in person, Wayzz does not find her as a suitable person to be chosen to wield a Miraculous. He wonders how could Marinette given a Miraculous to her until Wang Fu told him that Marinette would never willfully give one to her.

=== [[Plagg]] ===
[[File:SB (385).png|thumb|Wayzz agrees to join Plagg and the other kwamis.]] Wayzz and Plagg get along well treating each other as friends but in &quot;[[Style Queen (Queen's Battle - Part 1)|Style Queen]]&quot;, Wayzz becomes cross with Plagg when the latter denies all the trouble he caused in the past. Despite that the two can work well together seen in &quot;Sandboy&quot;.

== Trivia ==
{{SpoilerButton}}
* [[Thomas Astruc]] revealed her existence by releasing an image of her hugging Adrien as a sneak peek with the caption, &quot;Where is she?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/663056219809140736&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:VP (47).png|thumb|Adrien looking at the painting of Emile Agreste in Gabriel's atelier.]]
*There is a portrait of her in Gabriel's [[Gabriel's atelier|atelier]] in the [[Agreste mansion]].
** The portrait resembles Gustav Klimt's ''[[Wikipedia:Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I|Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'', commonly known as ''The Woman in Gold'' or ''The Lady in Gold''.
** Behind the painting, there is a secret safe, in which Gabriel keeps the [[Peacock Miraculous]] and a booklet that reads &quot;TIBET&quot; in big green letters in front of a picture of her.
** &quot;The Collector&quot; reveals that the painting has hidden buttons that open the secret entrance to Hawk Moth's [[Hawk Moth's lair|lair]].
* The image of her used as Adrien's computer background is actually a real-life photo of voice actress [[Wikipedia:Tara Strong|Tara Strong]], with the top changed from magenta to blue and Emilie's face edited over Tara's face.&lt;ref&gt;http://i.imgur.com/paa82UK.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;
** The writers admitted at an event that they modeled Emilie's design on Tara, whom they favor because of her work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Miraculous_US/status/864931446485426176 Twitter account Miraculous_US recording information from an event with the writers on May 17, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;
** At Tara Strong's 2016 Q&amp;A panel at Indy Popcon, a fan asked her if she was aware of the photo resembling her. Though she agreed there were definite similarities, she had no knowledge of it until then. &lt;ref&gt;http://wintermoth.tumblr.com/post/146114752777/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/s87-aKjREDs?t=148&lt;/ref&gt;
* A picture of her is inside of the [[Butterfly Miraculous]]. 
* &quot;A Christmas Special&quot; reveals that she disappeared some time in the last year, as it is Adrien's first Christmas without her.
* A future episode will track the relationship between Emilie and Gabriel.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Miraculous_US/status/864931684566712320 More information from the event May 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;Gorizilla&quot; reveals that Emilie was the leading actress in the film ''[[Solitude]]''. Because of the emotional attachment that Gabriel has to the film due to her role in it, he forbade his son from watching it, though he later changed his mind.
* In &quot;Party Crasher&quot;, Emilie has a collection of old records that Adrien keeps his room.
{{HideSpoiler|
* In the ''Miraculous Secrets'' webisode &quot;[[Gabriel (webisode)|Gabriel]]&quot;, Gabriel says he and Emilie used the Peacock Miraculous and if they hadn't she &quot;wouldn't be where [she] is now&quot;, implying that the Miraculous is responsible for her current condition.}}

== Personality ==
[[File:HF S01EP11 (207).png|left|thumb|Max reading off the time the film crew has left.]]
Max is a gamer and a fan of technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://miraculeusecoccinelle.tumblr.com/post/129733355946/miraculous-les-aventures-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir&lt;/ref&gt; He is smart, especially when it comes to mathematics, as seen when he figures out how fast Kim needs to be to make it to [[Pont des Arts]] right before [[Chloé Bourgeois]] gets there in &quot;[[Dark Cupid]]&quot;. He tends to be carried away with his knowledge, often over-explaining things with further detail than necessary and occasionally revealing something that was supposed to be a secret. Max is also friendly, helping his friends with knowledge and support. In &quot;Gamer&quot;, when he loses his place in the competition for which he trained a whole year, he sportingly congratulates Marinette and Adrien before he quickly leaves the room. Once outside, he starts rambling to himself about how unfair his situation was, and it isn't until after his akumatization and Marinette offering up her spot to him in the competition that he perks up.

As Pegasus, he shown to be very polite and he works well with others seen in &quot;Party Crasher&quot;.

As Gamer, he stops at nothing to show everyone that he's the best gamer, even turning people into experience points that help him level up. Additionally, the resentment he held towards Marinette turns into hatred, resulting in him specifically targeting her for a brief period. In &quot;Gamer 2.0&quot;, nevertheless, he can be humble when admitting defeat.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Max is very intelligent, being excellent at knowing facts, statistics, and calculations. He is also very skilled in playing video games and he has one of the highest scores in the entire school at playing ''[[Ultimate Mecha Strike III]]''.

Max's intelligence was shown in his inventions that are revealed in &quot;[[Robostus]]&quot;: an [[Max's flash drive|anti-virus flash drive]] and [[Markov]], a highly-functional robot that has developed emotions on its own. Max is even capable of creating his own video game based on the akumatized villains.

=== As Gamer ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
As soon as he transforms into Gamer, he gets a giant fighting robot designed after MX-01 from ''Ultimate Mecha Strike III''. He starts off with the robot's Level 1 form, a simple floating black pyramid with a green eye, but by shooting at the population and cars, he turns them into experience points that make him level up. Level 2 adds two tall tentacle-like legs. Level 3 makes the robot more human-like and gives it the power to perform some special moves, such as firing electricity and missiles, creating a force field and spinning to make a drill. Level 4 is the final level, but its form is unknown.

With his glasses, Gamer is able to save his last level and respawn in case his robot is destroyed.

In &quot;Gamer 2.0&quot;, Gamer's powers allow him to summon many of the previously akumatized villains so that Ladybug, Cat Noir and himself may use them as avatars to fight. Gamer is also able to take the form of any of the akumatized villains and access their powers and abilities

=== As Pegasus ===
Pegasus has much more enhanced skills, such as speed, agility, and strength, and he is almost invulnerable to physical damage. He is also very skilled at utilizing his [[Horseshoe|horseshoes]] during close combat.

His special [[Horse Miraculous Superpower|power]] allows him to create a portal that he can travel through and exit at any location he desires.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Lê Chiến Kim]] ===
[[File:DC S01EP10 (155).png|thumb|Max and Kim doing a high five to celebrate their Valentines' Day plan.]]
Max is best friends with Kim. They are usually seen around each other and sit next to each other in class. Max supports Kim, helping him prepare to express his feelings to Chloé in &quot;[[Dark Cupid]]&quot;.

In &quot;Party Crasher&quot;, the two work together with their friends to have a party for Adrien.

He meets Kim's alter ego, King Monkey as his alter ego Pegasus and the two work well together.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:TG (897).png|left|thumb|Marinette giving up her position to Max.]]
Generally, Max and Marinette get along nicely. In &quot;Gamer&quot;, he becomes upset with Marinette for beating him at ''Ultimate Mecha Strike III'' and becoming the second student to go to the tournament, which he tries to hide but fails to over time. After she offers up her place for him, though, he gains a lot more respect for her, and he encourages her when she ends up being his partner. Max appreciates Marinette's bravery and compassion, grateful for her trying to get Markov back for him in &quot;Robostus&quot;, and he cares enough about her to team up with other students to try fighting off the [[Gina Dupain|titular villain]] and her minions to protect her in &quot;[[Befana]]&quot;.

Max sees Ladybug as a wonderful protector of Paris, and he appreciates her greatly. In &quot;Robostus&quot;, he takes her advice that he should forgive Markov because people sometimes struggle to control their emotions.

As Pegasus, Max follows Ladybug's instructions and lead faithfully seen in &quot;Party Crasher&quot;.

=== [[Markov]] ===
[[File:MarkovAndMax.jpg|thumb|Max defends Markov.]] Max cherishes Markov, both as his creation and his close friend. He fully supports that Markov has his own personality and emotions, and he enjoys working together with him. When [[Mr. Damocles]] confiscates Markov, Max worries about his robot's reaction to being separated from him for the first time. While Markov is akumatized into Robostus, Max is alarmed by his friend's villainous actions, and he defies him and his wishes to become human by freeing Ladybug and Cat Noir before their [[Miraculouses]] are taken, telling Robostus that he likes him the way he was before akumatization and he doesn't want him harming the heroes. Once Markov is back to normal, Max is initially unsure and worried about reactivating Markov, but after Ladybug encourages him to forgive Markov because he cares about him, Max goes through with it and warmly greets him. The two continue spending time together seen in &quot;Syren&quot; and &quot;Party Crasher&quot;.

=== [[Nino Lahiffe]] ===
In &quot;[[Horrificator]]&quot; Max helps Nino with his film by calculating the hours they have left to film it, as well as helping his classmate put together a boys-only party for Adrien by providing Nino with the dolls they need to &quot;bribe&quot; [[Adrien's bodyguard]], and making the party itself a bit more exciting in &quot;Party Crasher&quot;.

He and Nino meet has their alter egos in &quot;Party Crasher&quot;.

=== [[Luka Couffaine]] ===
Max doesn't know Luka too well, even though Luka attended the boys-only party that Max helped Nino put together for Adrien in &quot;Party Crasher&quot;.

When they assume their alter egos, Pegasus shows concern for Viperion when he gets captured by [[Wayhem|Party Crasher]].

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' was an OmuHimba girl. She was a past [[Miraculous holders|Miraculous holder]], wielding the [[Ladybug Miraculous]] and transforming into a ladybug-themed superhero when [[Tikki]] inhabited them.

== See also ==
''See [[Wikipedia: Himba people|Wikipedia:Himba people]]''

== Appearance ==
Mudekudeku wore a traditional calfskin skirt and jewelry that depicts her social status. On her ankles were jewelry that protected her against venomous animals. Because her entire body was red with black spots, indicating the area protected by the Ladybug Miraculous — which she used to transform — it can be assumed that the magic acted like ''otjize'' paste. She had several ''otjize'' hair plaits.

== Abilities ==
If this past Ladybug Miraculous holder had the same powers as the current Ladybug ([[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]]), she had enhanced abilities and the superpowers [[Lucky Charm]] and [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]]. She also had the [[yo-yo]] for a weapon.

== Trivia ==
* [[Thomas Astruc]] drew Mudekudeku in an image created for a fan-made charity magazine. She appears in the image with [[Jeanne d'Arc]], [[Hippolyta]], and Ladybug (Marinette).&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/722401644454027264&lt;/ref&gt;
* Her name means &quot;The Great Ladybug&quot; in Bantu.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/722479346414456832&lt;/ref&gt;
* Because her hair is not acting as a veil, it can be assumed that she has passed the age of puberty. Since she does not wear an ''Erembe'' in her hair, it can additionally be assumed that she is not married. Likewise, she is not considered a woman among her people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zambezi.com/blog/2015/himba-people-namibia/&lt;/ref&gt;

Her Miraculous was somehow damaged, as stated by [[Gabriel Agreste]] in &quot;[[Mayura (Heroes' Day - Part 2)|Mayura]]&quot;. As of that same episode, [[Nathalie Sancoeur]] is Duusu's current owner, using her powers for evil.

Her tail, reminiscent of that of a real peacock, contains five feathers. The eyes of the feathers are pale crimson, with a black interior and a dark blue exterior. She also has three feathers coming out from behind her head, the central one of which is longer than those to its left and right. Her mouth is a plum color and contains rows of teeth on the top and the bottom.

{{For2|more of Duusu's designs|Duusu/Designs}}

{{HideSpoiler|
== Personality ==
Duusu has a very sporadic personality, she can be happy one minute and then overly sad the next, whether or not this is a result of her Miraculous being damaged is unknown. She is very easily excited and seems to enjoy chaos, as seen in &quot;[[Reflekdoll]]&quot;, though she is very concerned for Nathalie's health.}}

== Abilities ==
Duusu is able to fly, levitate, phase through solid objects and carry objects that are larger and/or heavier than her.

As a kwami, Duusu is able to transform the holder of the Peacock Miraculous into a peacock-themed superhero or super-villain and gain the power of [[Amokization]].

{{HideSpoiler|
== Relationships ==
=== [[Nathalie Sancoeur]] ===
Although Nathalie wields her powers for evil, Duusu still cares for Nathalie, as she is upset over Nathalie collapsing in exhaustion in &quot;[[Reflekdoll]]&quot;.

=== [[Gabriel Agreste]] ===
Not much is fully known between Gabriel and Duusu, but Duusu does obey him after he scolds her and tells her sternly that Nathalie needs to rest.

=== [[Nooroo]] ===
Duusu is friends with Nooroo, though in &quot;[[Reflekdoll]]&quot;, she is oblivious to how Nooroo is concerned about her mental condition.
}}

== History ==
=== Before Season 1===
When the concept of emotion into existence, Duusu came into existence. Before the Miraculouses were created, Duusu and the other kwamis traveled all over the universe, unable to interact with humans. Eventually, a [[Unnamed mage|mage]] created the Miraculouses, which allowed humans to see kwamis and the kwamis to help them.

For an unknown amount of time, Duusu had been dormant in the Peacock Miraculous, stored in the [[Miracle Box]] at the [[Guardians' temple|temple]] of the [[Order of the Guardians]] and started in [[Ancient Chinese Peacock Miraculous holder|China]]. More than one hundred years ago, Master Fu's mistake resulted in not only the destruction of the temple, but also in the loss of the Peacock and Butterfly Miraculouses. At some point in recent times, Gabriel Agreste found the Butterfly Miraculous and the Peacock Miraculous, and he took them with him back to [[Paris]].

=== Season 1 ===
Throughout the first season, Duusu was dormant in the Peacock Miraculous in the safe of Gabriel Agreste's mansion.

=== Season 2 ===
In &quot;Sandboy&quot;, she was briefly mentioned by [[Sass]], who said that he had not heard from her for a long time.

In &quot;Mayura&quot;, her Miraculous becomes temporarily activated by the titular villain to save Hawk Moth, and was returned to Gabriel's safe afterwards.

=== Season 3 ===
In &quot;[[Miraculer]]&quot;, Duusu is briefly activated by her owner to transform into Mayura, though she isn't seen on screen.

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;[[Reflekdoll]]&quot;, Duusu is briefly activated by Nathalie to become Mayura and create the sentimonster Reflekdoll. After Mayura and Hawk Moth are defeated, she expresses excitement over what happened but becomes concerned when Nathalie begins coughing and falls to the floor. She is told by Gabriel that Nathalie will be fine but she needs peace and quiet.}}

== Trivia ==
* She was first revealed by [[Jeremy Zag]] with a picture posted on his Instagram on June 27, 2016. The post did not contain any comments from him.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHJtWS2Ay8K/&lt;/ref&gt;
** The [https://twitter.com/BeMiraculousLB official Miraculous Ladybug Twitter], however, did comment on the image, stating &quot;Who do you think is hiding behind the peacock kwami? 💙 &quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/BeMiraculousLB/status/747470679889575938&lt;/ref&gt;
* As seen in the concept art, when she cries, her tears appear to glitter.
** This idea, however, is part of an old concept and may not be true in the completed version of the character.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/749968635855302656&lt;/ref&gt;
* Her name was revealed on October 7, 2016, during the ''Miraculous'' panel at New York Comic-Con.
** Duusu's name may be based on the Slavic word &quot;''duša''&quot;, meaning &quot;soul.&quot;
* Also, another piece of concept art that was revealed shows Duusu with her Miraculous' future holder, which later turned out to be Nathalie Sancoeur.
* Her first appearance in any ''Miraculous'' media is in the second issue of ''Miraculous Adventures'', alongside several kwamis, known and unknown, as they fly through space in a flashback.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/ActionLab/status/870266305332613120&lt;/ref&gt;
* Out of all the known kwamis, she is the only one who didn't appear in &quot;Sandboy&quot;, however, she was mentioned by Sass. 
* She and Nooroo are the currently the only known kwamis who have fallen into the hands of a villain.
* From her peacock based appearance, being called &quot;the peafowl&quot; by Sass in &quot;Sandboy&quot; and her feminine pronunciation, Duusu appears to be based off of a peahen which is a female peafowl.
** But unlike a peahen, Duusu has coloration and plumage similar to that of a peacock.

{{Quote|Ho, ho, ho! No need to grab now, children. Good old Santa Claus has a gift for everyone.|Santa Claus|&quot;[[Santa Claws]]&quot;||quotelink = yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a man dressed up as Santa for the Christmas season.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDCC&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/s41hZu9Qbes?t=1617&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[Santa Claws]]&quot;, when [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] upsets Santa by wrongly accusing him of being a [[Akumatized villains|villain]], he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and becomes '''Santa Claws''', a Christmas-themed supervillain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/MLadyblogFrance/status/801105365131755520 Translation from French synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/806163770519257089&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Santa is tall and overweight with balding white hair, a large, thick white beard, and blue eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
On top of his head, he wears a red Santa hat with white trim around the bottom edge and tip of the hat. He wears a large red Santa suit with a white trim on the end of the sleeves, top of the hood, lining, and bottom. Where the sleeves end, a large, black, fingerless gloves reach down to his knuckles. He also wears a thick black belt with a golden buckle around his waist, red pants with white trim on the cuffs, and black boots.

=== As Santa Claws ===
Santa Claws's skin is green, his eyes are red with yellow sclerae, his beard includes many pointed tips, and he has long fingernails. He wears a black mask over the top of his face and [[Adrien's Christmas hat]]. While the red part of the suit is the same, the bottom edge is jagged, and his gloves include silver spots and a silver jagged line below the fingers, along with red edges on the finger holes. His belt is black with silver spots and a silver Christmas tree-shaped buckle, and on his back is a red bag with white trim on the top edge. His pants are still red with thicker white trim on the cuffs, and his boots are black with silver bottoms and red soles. He also has a black sled with red patches on the side and back and rockets on the back that blast green fire, two black and red reindeer being connected to it.

== Personality ==
[[File:Ladybug Christmas Special (216).png|thumb|left|197x197px|Santa Claus comforting Adrien]] Santa is warm, kind, and generous. He enjoys giving to others and helping them out, and he gives useful wisdom to those who need it, like Adrien. However, if he is disrespected or falsely accused of something, he becomes grouchy and upset, along with sometimes not easily forgiving the culprits.

{{SpoilerButton}}
{{HideSpoiler|As seen in &quot;Christmaster&quot;, he is also very stern and strict towards tradition, refusing to give out gifts to kids early as such, and highly appreciates those who respects them, such as Ladybug.}}

As Santa Claws, he is menacing, bitter, and cruel. He gets revenge on those who he dislikes or who harmed him with terrifying gifts, and he enjoys singing songs to proclaim his evil gifts. Despite his villainous nature, Santa Claws holds nothing against Adrien, wanting to avenge both Adrien and himself, and he likes getting gifts and praise for being a frightening villain.

== Abilities ==

=== As a civilian ===
Santa Claus knows how to reign two horses to use a sled.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Santa Claws can fly with the help of his akumatized reindeer and sleigh with handles like a motorcycle, the sleigh also able to become intangible to pass through walls and windows. From the sack on his back, he conjures wrapped presents that explode with green smoke, sometimes also containing terrifying creatures like bats, tarantulas, and cockroaches. His magically created presents can also contain weapons which he can wield, like a sword and a mace.

*In the &quot;Christmas Special&quot; Santa Claws is merely a man who dresses like Santa, whereas in &quot;Christmaster&quot; The real Santa Claus is present.

{{Quote|You're absolutely right, Alya. I'm sure the three of you will make quite a team! You have all the making of a true superhero. You're strong, brave. But most of all, you're trustworthy.|Trixx|&quot;[[Sapotis]]&quot;|quotelink = yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/stelllalights/status/784490783810416640&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Kwamis|kwami]] of '''Illusion''' who is connected to the [[Fox Miraculous]]. With his power, his [[Miraculous holders|wearer]] can use the necklace to transform into a fox-themed superhero. He is currently dormant inside his Miraculous in the [[Miracle Box]], but he temporarily becomes active to help [[Alya Césaire|Alya]] transform into Rena Rouge.

== Appearance ==
Trixx is a small orange creature that is 10 centimeters (or 4 inches) in height.&lt;ref&gt;Confirmed to [[User:BelieveInMagic814]] by the official [https://officialmiraculousladybug.tumblr.com/ Miraculous Ladybug Tumblr blog].&lt;/ref&gt; He has purple eyes, eyelashes on the side of his eyes, and two fox incisors. A small dark brown spot is above each of his eyes, appearing like eyebrows. He has long fox-like ears with white insides and black tips and edges, and he has a thick flexible tail with a white tip. His forearms and lower legs are black, and the front of his body and the area around his mouth are white.

== Personality ==
Trixx is friendly, encouraging, wise, and a good judge of character, as he identifies his new wielder's best qualities very easily. He is honest when something impresses him, like Alya quickly figuring out he transforms her with the Fox Miraculous, but he is smart in giving good advice without being rude or blunt, as seen when Nino questions Alya about her decision in not telling him her secret.[https://miraculousladybug.fandom.com/wiki/Heroes'_Day]

Similiar to Tikki, Trixx is also very understanding of others' actions after the mission was over in &quot;Sapotis&quot;, when he heard that Alya made a promise to return the Miraculous. He was willing to return to the necklace without any resistance and also understood Alya's burning desire to continue helping her new teammates by commenting that the three of them would make a good team.  

== Abilities ==
Trixx is able to fly, levitate, phase through solid objects and carry objects that are larger and/or heavier than him.

As a kwami, Trixx gives the wearer the power of illusion and transforms them into a fox-themed superhero by entering the Fox Miraculous. Whenever the wearer uses [[Mirage]], Trixx begins losing power and eventually detransforms in about 5 minutes. Then Trixx has to recharge by eating.

{{SpoilerButton}}
{{HideSpoiler|It seems that Trixx can fuse his powers with Mullo to create the hybrid wielder [[Multimouse with Fox Miraculous]].}}

== Relationships ==
=== [[Alya Césaire]] ===
[[File:Sapotis-000997.png|thumb|Trixx encourages Alya to do the right thing.]]
Trixx gets along well with Alya, impressed by her observational skills and heroic qualities. While liking her, he encourages her to do the right thing, complimenting her but also reminding her that she is trustworthy, the push Alya needs to respect [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and return the Fox Miraculous to her.

In &quot;[[Syren]]&quot;, &quot;[[Catalyst]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Mayura]]&quot;, under the permission of Wang Fu, he and his Miraculous are given to Alya to help Ladybug and Cat Noir.


=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] ===
[[File:Sapotis-000612.png|thumb|left|Trixx and Ladybug.]]
Even though their interaction is brief, he is trustful of Ladybug's judgement in picking Alya to wield the Fox Miraculous. He is also respectful and understanding towards Ladybug when the Miraculous is returned.




=== [[Nino Lahiffe]] ===
Though their interaction is brief, when Nino learns that Alya is Rena Rouge and asks why she never told him, Trixx reminds him that a superhero must keep their identity secret.

== Trivia ==
* Trixx's name was revealed on October 7, 2016 during the Miraculous Ladybug panel at New York Comic-Con.
* The real Fox Miraculous holder (Rena Rouge), not [[Lila Rossi|Lila]]'s [[Akumatized villains|akumatized form]], &quot;will be potentially a recurring character,&quot; as was revealed at the Miraculous Ladybug Anime Expo 2016 panel, which suggested that Trixx would also appear.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED8bC3LL_x8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1069&lt;/ref&gt;
* His appearance was first revealed by Miraculous fan Kenya Danino on August 5, 2016. She revealed the design on a clock she made that showcased all seven known kwamis.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/kdfoxx/status/761797580418387968&lt;/ref&gt;
** It was later confirmed that the design she had shared was, in fact, the real appearance of the character.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/761857260238868480&lt;/ref&gt;
** After Trixx's name was revealed, along with some concept art, at New York Comic Con 2016 Kenya posted a piece of concept art of him by [[Nathanaël Bronn]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/kdfoxx/status/784603976130060290&lt;/ref&gt;
* Besides the English and the Korean dubs, Trixx's voice is more noticeably feminine in most multilingual dubs. However, in some dubs, the kwami has a more distinctly masculine voice.
** Trixx uses male pronouns in the French, Catalan, European Spanish, German, Italian, and Latin American Spanish dubs.
** Trixx uses female pronouns in the Korean, Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, European Portuguese, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Swedish, and Turkish dubs.
** It is unknown what pronouns Trixx uses officially in the English dub.
*** Trixx hasn't been referred to by any pronouns yet in the English translation of the show, but he has been referred to with female pronouns in DisneyChannelUK's YouTube video, &quot;Miraculous Ladybug | Meet the Kwamis! ✨&quot;.
* With Trixx being the kwami of illusions and having a fox-based appearance, he shares a resemblance to kitsunes from Japanese folklore which also the Japanese word for fox.
* Unlike all the other known kwamis, Trixx does not enter his Miraculous when transformed instead a ball of light flashes when the Miraculous is activated.
* Trixx is the second kwami to be akumatized, the first being [[Pollen]] and the third being [[Wayzz]].
** However this is indirectly.
* Trixx's name is based on the word &quot;tricks&quot; because in some folklore foxes are known for their cunning and trickery.

{{Quote|I wish I could be a superhero. The powers. The secrets. The costume. That would be awesome, right?|Kim|&quot;[[Syren]]&quot;|quotelink = yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref name=&quot;airplane&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/755033027823046656&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Kim Chiến Lê''' (in Western order), is a student in [[Miss Bustier's class]] at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]]. In &quot;[[Dark Cupid]]&quot;, after being rejected and humiliated by his crush [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]], he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and becomes '''Dark Cupid''', a hate-spreading [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].

In &quot;[[Party Crasher]]&quot;, in order to defeat the titular villain who had been able to capture Ladybug and her team, Kim receives the [[Monkey Miraculous]] from [[Wang Fu|Master Fu]]. When the Miraculous is inhabited by [[Xuppu]] he becomes '''King Monkey''', a monkey-themed superhero.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BySwkETARkC/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Kim is muscular and taller than the average student at school; he has olive skin and grey eyes. He styles his hair, which is black with the ends dyed gold, into a sharp quiff.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a red, short-sleeved hoodie jacket with big front pocket and hoodie and some white outlines at certain places. On the front of the jacket, there is a white logo, which is a downward-pointing pentagon outline outside of a smaller, filled-in pentagon with a red corner and a star. He pairs his top with navy blue track sweatpants, and red, white, and black sports shoes.

=== As Dark Cupid ===
Dark Cupid wears a black and red suit, along with large black wings attached to his back, each feather-like end of each tipped with two red stripes. On the sides of his neck, there are black lightning bolts. He wears a black head cover, the areas covering the top of his hair and around his eyes being red. The top of his suit is red, with a large white broken heart on his chest. To the waist down, the suit is black. From the elbow down to the hand is black, and from the knee down is red with a few strands of cloth sticking out above the back of each ankle. On his back is a black, red, and white striped quiver, which carries red arrows. On the quiver strap across his chest, the [[List of akumatized objects|brooch]], which is now red and black, is attached to it. His archery bow is based off a breaking heart. The handle is white with red heart halves at the ends, and on each side of the bow, there are two large gray and white spikes.

=== As King Monkey ===
As King Monkey, Kim wears a gold and dark brown mask that covers up most of his head, with the exception of his eyes, mouth and nose, ears, and hair. The Monkey Miraculous gains five black squares on the back once inhabited by Xuppu and is the division between Kim's hair and his mask. His hair becomes one spike on the top of his head, resembling a fire as his hair becomes toned red and orange, brown at the roots. Kim's suit resembles that of a track suit, being separated in two. His top piece is a light brown and at the center covering his stomach and pectorals is a light tan-ish color. A golden zipper rests at the base of the top, just underneath the collar of his suit. He has black shoulder pads that extend down to his upper arm with golden borders. He wears gloves that extend off of his suit. They are golden at his fingers, dark brown at his wrist, light brown at the rest and have tan cuffs. A golden belt with a dark brown buckle and brown spots on either side of his hips rests at his waist, separating the top from the bottom. At the back of his belt is a rope attached to a hook with a golden tip that resembles the tail of a monkey. His pants are all light brown like the top, however, at his calves, there is a dark brown section with gold borders. His boots are similar to his gloves, extending away from the body. Like [[Nino Lahiffe|Carapace]], there is a division between his big toe and the rest of his foot. His soles reach up to the top of his foot and are golden, with brown highlights and the cuffs of his boots are golden. He carries a [[Ruyi Jingu Bang]] with gold on either end.

== Personality ==
[[File:AM-(223).png|left|thumb|Kim bragging about being faster than a panther.]]
Kim is the &quot;king of competitions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://miraculeusecoccinelle.tumblr.com/post/129733355946/miraculous-les-aventures-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoys making dares, much to the frustration of his classmates, and he is also very confident in himself and his athletic abilities, thus most of his dares involve using the person's body. Over-confident and proud, Kim sometimes boasts about his abilities and doesn't always take facts into consideration, believing he can beat a panther in a race in &quot;[[Animan]].&quot; He isn't afraid to tease others, either, as he gives [[Ivan Bruel|Ivan]] a note telling him that he isn't brave enough to act on his romantic feelings. Behind his bravado are a few insecurities, like his fear of being humiliated and rejected. While hot-headed and rude sometimes, Kim is generally kind, appreciating Marinette's encouragement to confess his love to his crush in &quot;Dark Cupid&quot; — although Marinette isn't aware that his crush is Chloé. In &quot;[[Syren]]&quot;, Kim admires Ladybug and Cat Noir so much that he wants to be a hero himself and is curious on how to become one.

As Dark Cupid, he is greatly bitter at love and seeks to avenge his broken heart by destroying all the love in Paris with his arrows. He is still very prideful but has no issues teaming up with one of his victims, like [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]], to succeed.

As King Monkey, most of Kim's personality traits remain the same. However, as seen in &quot;[[Party Crasher]]&quot;, Kim is a little goofier and silly while he goes one-on-one with the titular villain, albeit everyone else had been defeated. He is also heroic and it can be assumed he is loyal as after Party Crasher is defeated, he is seen without the Miraculous which means he must have returned it to Ladybug or back in the place he found it for Master Fu to take it back.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Kim is a very fast runner, being able to almost keep up with Alix, who was wearing roller skates, when they raced in &quot;[[Timebreaker]]&quot;. In &quot;Animan&quot;, Kim states that he came in first place in the County Athletics Tournament. As seen in &quot;Syren&quot;, he is also a good swimmer. In the same episode it's also shown that Kim can use his own feet to hold things, as if they were hands.

=== As Dark Cupid ===
&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; widths=&quot;250&quot; crop=&quot;true&quot;&gt;

DC S01EP10 (467).png|Alya insulting Marinette while under the effect of the arrows.
DC S01EP10 (958).png|Ladybug breaking Cat Noir's curse with a kiss.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Dark Cupid can fly with his wings. Using his bow and rose-shaped black arrows, he shoots people, turning their feelings of love and friendship into hate.

The effect of the arrows varies from person to person; for example, [[Alya Césaire|Alya]] becomes mean-spirited to [[Marinette_Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]], while Cat Noir gets filled by the desire to destroy Ladybug. The lips of people affected by his arrows turn black.

Similarly to fairy tales with curses, the effect of the arrows can be reverted by a kiss.

=== As King Monkey ===
King Monkey has super enhanced skills, such as speed, agility, and strength, and he is almost invulnerable to physical damage.

His special power, [[Uproar]], allows him to creates an item that upon contact, makes the target's powers to malfunction for a short period of time.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Max Kanté]] ===
[[File:DC S01EP10 (121).png|thumb|Max helping Kim to ask Chloé out.]]

Kim and Max are best friends. Kim seems to trust Max a lot, as seen when he followed his friend's advice to ask Chloé out in &quot;Dark Cupid&quot;. He thinks Max is unbeatable at video games and cheers him on in &quot;[[Gamer]]&quot;, and feels bad when Max loses to Marinette. He also knows about and supports Max's inventions and intelligence, impressed with the arm that Max added to [[Markov]] since the previous time he saw the robot. The two often hang out together, such as going to the zoo in &quot;Animan&quot;.
He shows great concern for Max when he gets to turn into a minion in &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot;.

He and Max meet as their alter egos in &quot;Party Crasher&quot; and work well together.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:DC S01EP10 (309).png|left|thumb|Kim asking Chloé to be his Valentine.]]

Kim often hangs around Chloé and sometimes does her bidding. He has a crush on Chloé, but she rebukes his attempt to tell her his feelings with a gift, also humiliating him in the process. During his time as Dark Cupid, he goes for revenge against her, but he decides not to, believing that she is already heartless and shouldn't bother wasting an arrow on her. Despite his unknown feelings, he is aware of how awful she is, like when he prefers not to run for class president in &quot;[[Darkblade]]&quot; because she threatens to tell everyone about his fear of spiders. In &quot;[[Despair Bear]]&quot;, he asks her to dance with him, not detecting her growing jealousy at Marinette dancing with Adrien while they're together. He is amused when he sees Chloé's teddy bear, [[Mr. Cuddly]], being used by [[Butler Jean]] to keep her on her best behavior, but later, he tries to protect her from a possessed [[Sabrina Raincomprix|Sabrina]] like a &quot;knight in shining armor.&quot;

[[File:DSB_(505).png|thumb|Kim asks Chloé to dance.]]In &quot;Zombizou&quot;, Kim along with the other students knows that Chloé is responsible for a handful of the akumas in the city. But understanding that she is a part of Ladybug's plan, he sacrifices himself so everyone can escape. In “Syren”, he tells Ondine that he has invited Chloé to the movies with him; however, he later finds that she doesn’t show up. In &quot;Malediktator&quot;, Kim is overjoyed when Chloé leaves for New York.

=== [[Alix Kubdel]] ===
[[File:Timebreaker_(294).png|thumb|left|Alix and Kim compete.]]Kim often competes with Alix as he challenges her to several of his dares. His most recent dare involved a race around the school to see if he is faster than her roller skates. When facing off, both in fun like to insult each other and brag about their own abilities. On other occassions, they seem to be friendly around each other, such as taking a selfie with [[Mr. Damocles]] in &quot;[[The Dark Owl]].&quot;

=== [[Ivan Bruel]] ===
[[File:OR1-(353).png|thumb|Kim annoyed Ivan]]
Kim usually seems to get along okay with Ivan, but he isn't afraid to get on Ivan's bad side. In &quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)|Ladybug &amp;amp; Cat Noir]]&quot;, Kim, aware of Ivan's crush on [[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]], gives him a note saying that he isn't brave enough to ask her out. Ivan attempts to punch him, which doesn't faze him as he looks on in amusement. However, he is terrified when Ivan as Stoneheart attacks him, and the next day in &quot;[[Stoneheart (Origins - Part 2)|Stoneheart]]&quot;, he comments that Ivan was seriously out to harm him.

=== [[Ondine]] ===
[[File:Syren (73).png|thumb|left|Kim plays a game of secrets with Ondine.]]
Kim and Ondine are seen to be good friends, having made up their own game called &quot;Secrets.&quot; They get along well, and are comfortable around each other. Kim is oblivious to her crush on him, but after learning her feelings, he invites her to the movies with him, implying that he may return those feelings.

=== [[Wang Fu|Master Fu]] ===
Kim and Master Fu meet at the boys-only party at Adrien's house. When Master Fu nearly fell off the cooler he was standing on, Kim quickly caught him, impressing the guardian and making him decide to give Kim the Monkey Miraculous.

=== [[Xuppu]] ===
Shortly after Kim meets Xuppu, he took offence to the kwami calling him &quot;nitwit&quot; and sticking his tongue at him before Kim &quot;fights back&quot; with his own silly face, in which led to the two &quot;bonding&quot; through the silly faces they made and mimic from each other, before the Monkey Kwami helps Kim to become King Monkey.

* In the French dubbed version, Kim's villain name is &quot;Dislocoeur&quot;.
** Dislocoeur is intended to be a pun in French, &quot;-cœur&quot; meaning &quot;heart&quot; and &quot;dis-&quot; alluding to &quot;disloquer&quot;, meaning &quot;break&quot;.
* In the French dubbed version, Kim's superhero name is &quot;Roi Singe&quot; that means literally &quot;Monkey King&quot; or &quot;King Monkey&quot;.
** Which is also a coincidence that his super hero attire looks a lot like a Monkey King.
* While it is unknown what sports Kim plays specifically, Kim has made references to playing soccer in the French version, which is called football outside of the US.&lt;ref&gt;At the beginning of the French version of &quot;Dark Cupid&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;Darkblade&quot;, he is holding a basketball.
** Kim also makes a baseball metaphor in the English version of &quot;Dark Cupid&quot;.
** In the first issue of ''Miraculous Adventures'', Kim is on a lacrosse team with Adrien, Ivan, and Alix.
* Scarlet Dark Cupid reappears in the two-part special event &quot;[[Heroes' Day]]&quot;.
* Kim is the third person to be chosen to receive a Miraculous directly from Master Fu.
** Much like how it happened with Marinette and Adrien, Kim showed that he was worthy by helping Master Fu when he was in a tight situation.
* Kim is the sixth person to become an akumatized villain and a Miraculous holder, excluding [[Gabriel Agreste]], who akumatized himself.
* Kim is the second known person of Vietnamese origin to wield a Miraculous succeeding his Miraculous predecessor [[Bọ rùa]]. 
** But unlike Marinette and her origin Miraculous predecessors who owned the same jewel (the Ladybug Miraculous) and yet like Kagami and hers both Kim and Bọ rùa owned different Miraculous jewels.

{{Quote|Never, you see. Dancing and singing are everything to me. And I'm happy to share the joy of song and dance. To the amazing people of France!|Clara|&quot;[[Frightningale]]|quotelink=yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (called '''Laura Nightingale''' in some episodes) is a popular American musician introduced in the [[Season 2|second season]] of ''[[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]''. She is played by and based off of singer [[Laura Marano]], who performed the [[Miraculous - Laura Marano music video|Miraculous music video]].&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/vtO8bbvmU0g?t=39m4s&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[Frightningale]]&quot;, after [[André Bourgeois]] prevents Clara from shooting her music video &quot;Miraculous&quot; in [[Paris]], she is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Frightningale''', a singing, dancing, and rhyming [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/QdtzZQFlkRQ?t=204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tvmag.lefigaro.fr/programme-tv/miraculous-les-secrets-de-la-saison-2-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir_d32cc720-a2c3-11e7-b619-f944cd28c6f6/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
===Physical appearance ===
Clara is a peach-skinned young woman with waist-length wavy brown hair that is split on both sides and brown eyes.

===Civilian attire ===
She wears a short-sleeved white shirt with a navy blue trimming on the sleeves and collar and a white miniskirt, both having a pattern of yellow, magenta, cyan, and green triangles. On her right wrist, she has a yellow puffy bracelet, a black bead bracelet, and a wide magenta bracelet with cyan horizontal stripes. Additionally, she has black leggings that fade into dark blue at the bottom and black spool shoes.

=== As Frightningale ===
Frightningale has straight blonde hair tied back into two high ponytails with dark gray, star-shaped hair bands. She has heterochromia as her left eye is cyan and her right eye is magenta. The tips of her hair on her left ponytail and right side bang are red, and the tips on her right ponytail and left side bang are green. Her face is white, and she wears multicolored shades with star-like side edges. She wears a dark gray suit that has a light blue pointed tip over each shoulder. A cyan star with a black outline is printed on her chest, her upper back includes an upward shooting star design, and the rest of her suit is decorated with neon cyan, yellow, and magenta shapes. At her feet, she has pink platform soles and cyan high heels. She also holds a wand with a dark blue swirled handle, a rounded pink bottom tip, a black star at the top, and a white-edged pink circle between the star and the handle.

== Personality ==
[[File:FN_(400).png|thumb|Clara energetically welcomes everyone.]]
Clara is a very energetic when talking with [[Alec Cataldi]] about her new music videos. She is constantly dancing to the tune while talking, and according to [[Marinette]], she's very passionate about her music. Clara is clever; knowing she has to choose among many auditioners, she purposely trips to find someone who would act like Ladybug.

As Frightningale, she remains energetic, but is mischievous and cunning, as shown when she almost tricks [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] into not rhyming and becoming a statue. She's also childish, saying that Ladybug and Cat Noir being tied together is cheating and will not be permitted.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Clara is exceptional at singing and dancing. She speaks in rhymes and is able to do so without fail.

=== As Frightningale ===
Frightningale has enhanced physical prowess: she can jump incredible heights, hurl huge objects (such as buses), and run extremely quickly. Using her microphone, Frightningale can extend a pink energy whip which colors them with a pink aura whenever it hits people. If the victim is struck with the whip and fail to speak in rhymes or dance, the aura turns them into a magenta statue.

== History ==
=== Season 2 ===
In &quot;[[The Dark Owl]]&quot;, Clara's music video, &quot;Big Bang&quot; was seen from [[Marinette's computer]] with Tikki dancing along to the music.

In &quot;[[Captain Hardrock]]&quot;, she was at the [[Louvre|Louvre Museum]] setting up her concert for the National Music Festival.

In &quot;[[Frightningale]]&quot;, Clara was holding auditions for her newest music video at the [[Grand Palais]], her Cat Noir having already been chosen: [[Adrien]]. No one who came to audition for Ladybug was the right fit but, seeing many extras, Clara purposely tripped to see which one of them would act like Ladybug, and she singled out [[Marinette]], asking her to play the heroine. When Marinette declined in favor of being with her friends, Clara commended her with admiration. Clara then saw [[Chloé]] in action and, following [[Gabriel]]'s advice, gave her the part. But, Marinette then changed her mind and wanted the role herself and Clara excitedly agreed. Furious at not being cast as Ladybug with Adrien, Chloé managed to shut down the operation, which caused Clara to burst into tears and be akumatized by Hawk Moth into Frightningale. Despite having the heroes under her musical spell, she was eventually defeated. In the end, Clara was amazed that she was rescued by her favorite heroes and, following Ladybug's advice, was able to complete her video.

In &quot;[[Style Queen (Queen's Battle - Part 1)|Style Queen]]&quot;, Clara was seen sitting alongside with fellow musicians [[Jagged Stone]] and [[Penny Rolling]] at the fashion show where Adrien is modeling Marinette's pigeon-inspired hat.

In &quot;[[Queen Wasp (Queen's Battle - Part 2)|Queen Wasp]]&quot;, just like in the previous episode, Clara was seen sitting alongside with fellow musicians Jagged Stone and Penny Rolling at the fashion show where Adrien is modeling Marinette's pigeon-inspired hat.

In &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)|Catalyst]]&quot;, Clara witnessed Volpina's illusion of an akumatized Ladybug defeating Cat Noir and expressed devastation about it on a live interview with [[Nadja Chamack]]. Moments later, she was akumatized into Scarlet Frightningale.

In &quot;[[Mayura]]&quot;, Scarlet Frightningale along with Scarlet Guitar Villain played thunderous music for Scarlet Moth while his akumatized army fought the [[French Miraculous superhero team]].

== Relationships ==
=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:FN_(542).png|thumb|left|Clara offers Marinette the role of Ladybug.]]
When none of the people who audition to play Ladybug seem right, Clara purposely trips in front of the extras to see which one of them would act like Ladybug. When Marinette helps her up, Clara concludes that she has found the perfect Ladybug and asks Marinette to play the heroine. She doesn't mind when Marinette turns down the offer to be with her friends. However, when she changes her mind, Clara excitedly gives her the part.

Clara admires Ladybug so much that she makes a music video dedicated to her and Cat Noir. When Frightningale is defeated, Clara expresses excitement over being saved by her and takes her suggestion on how to finish her music video.

=== [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien Agreste/Cat Noir]] ===
[[File:FN_(448).png|thumb|Clara brings Adrien onstage.]]According to Gabriel, Clara is a huge fan of Adrien and immediately gives him the role of Cat Noir in her music video when Gabriel suggests it.

Clara admires Cat Noir so much that she makes a music video dedicated to him and Ladybug. When Frightningale is defeated, Clara expresses excitement over being saved by him.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:FN_(695).png|thumb|left|Clara watches Chloé's audition.]]
When Chloé auditions to play Ladybug, Clara comments on her talent and upon Gabriel's suggestion, decides to use her in her music video. However, she soon gives the part to Marinette instead, angering Chloé and prompting her to cancel Clara's music video, leaving the musician in tears and vulnerable to akumatization.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the &quot;queen&quot; of fashion designs, the wife of [[André Bourgeois]] and the mother of [[Chloé Bourgeois]].&lt;ref name=&quot;O Universo da TV&quot;&gt;http://www.ouniversodatv.com/2017/10/gloob-estreia-novos-episodios-de.html#axzz4ukj8DxGx&lt;/ref&gt; She was living in New York, but she is now currently staying in Paris with her family.

In &quot;[[Style Queen (Queen's Battle - Part 1)|Style Queen]]&quot;, which is part of the &quot;[[Queen's Battle]]&quot; special, after being humiliated by [[Gabriel Agreste]], she is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by Hawk Moth into '''Style Queen''', a glitter-themed supervillain.

{{HideSpoiler|In the episode &quot;[[Loveater (Battle of the Miraculous - Part 1)|Loveater]]&quot;, Audrey and her husband will be [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by Hawk Moth into '''Loveater''', [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].}}
 
== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Audrey has golden hair that is cut short into a sharp bob with short bangs that frames her round heart-shaped face, which is obscured by a pair of dark shades and covers her blue eyes. 

=== Civilian attire ===
Audrey wears a white sleeveless jumpsuit with a thick black stripe down the right side. The romper is long in length and bares around the shoulder blades. On her head, she adorns a black hat with black-and-yellow color stripes on the underside, yellow hat band, and a black-and-yellow flower on the left side. On her feet, she wears a pair of bright golden high-heel shoes. She also sports white evening gloves which reach up to just under her elbows. Her right ring finger is adorned with a gold ring with a modern design, though it is uncertain whether this is her wedding band or not.

=== As Style Queen ===
Style Queen has bright and sparkling golden skin. She wears sunglasses with dark shades over her eyes and her head appears to have pulled-back gilded hair in the style of a crown with five black pointed stones attached around the front. She wears a golden leotard designed with vertical strips of cloth, with a black strap on her left shoulder and pointed black edges around each leg. She has medallion high heeled boots. She holds a long gilded staff, having a bud-shaped tip with a black chevron line around it on top.

== Personality ==
Audrey is a bossy and demanding woman who only accepts what she wants. She will attempt to &quot;fire&quot; anyone who displeases her. In &quot;[[Style Queen (Queen's Battle - Part 1)|Style Queen]]&quot;, it's revealed that she's &quot;the harshest fashion critic in the world&quot; and has no problem causing a fuss for those who do not meet her demands, such as having an issue with the red carpet being made out of fabric instead of marble. Like her daughter, Audrey has an fierce, explosive temper and will get upset over minor things, such as being denied a front row seat.

To an extent, Audrey seems to have little care for her family, or at least their opinions. She expects her husband to cater to her demands of firing anyone she dislikes. When she is akumatized, she does allow Chloé to assist her but fires her the moment she catches her helping [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]]. However, this changes after Audrey learns how much she has in common with her daughter, deciding to spend more time in Paris with her.

As Style Queen, she is more malicious and vengeful. Her main goal is getting revenge against Gabriel Agreste for giving her a second row seat at his fashion show instead of a front row seat. When he's nowhere to be found, Style Queen instead turns his son into a glitter statue along with bystanders at the show.

== Abilities ==

=== Style Queen ===
Style Queen can transform people into golden statues using her specter . She can also teleport, which causes a puff of golden smoke. She has an intangible body made of golden glitter.

== Family ==
{{Bourgeois Tree}}

== Relationships ==
=== [[André Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:A6D3DA91-A3B1-4ABB-9E64-78296928EDB6.jpeg|thumb|left|Audrey tells her husband to fire the chauffeur.]]
Audrey is a bossy and demanding wife towards her husband as she constantly orders him to do various tasks for her like fire the [[Adrien's bodyguard|chauffeur]] in &quot;Style Queen&quot;. She forgets his name at times, though after she decides to stay in Paris, she stops forgetting it. In &quot;[[Malediktator]]&quot;, she demands that her husband close down the school and is irritated when he says he can't and is also annoyed when he refuses to come with them to New York. When she sees him akumatized, she merely criticized him and told him that it didn't make him cool or hip. After he is deakumatized, Audrey appears furious over what happened, but calms down when Chloé intervenes.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:ChloeAudrey.png|thumb|Chloé and Audrey bond after discovering how similar they are.]]Despite Chloé’s attempts to bond with her mother, Audrey doesn’t pay much attention to her daughter, dismissing the gift she tries to give her and even forgetting her name most of the time. As Style Queen, she allows Chloé to be her assistant but “fires” her when she catches her helping Ladybug. Later on, when asked by Chloé why she was taking Marinette to New York instead of her, Audrey said that it was because she wasn’t exceptional enough, which hurt Chloé to the point where she revealed the Bee Miraculous and transformed into Queen Bee to prove that she was exceptional to her mother. However, Audrey dismisses this as Chloé merely being a showoff and later expresses scorn at her daughter’s irresponsibility after an incident involving a subway train, leading to Queen Bee’s akumatization. After Chloé is deakumatized, Audrey says on live TV that there is nothing exceptional about her daughter.

However, thanks to Marinette, Audrey soon learns that she has a lot in common with Chloé and takes back her earlier comment. She decides to stay in Paris and be a part of Chloé’s life. In &quot;[[Malediktator]]&quot;, Audrey is shown to be closer with her daughter as she is so furious that Chloé learns about her failed presentation and Audrey demands André to close down the school for good.

===[[Gabriel Agreste]]===
[[File:GabrielAudrey.jpg|thumb|left|Audrey accepts Gabriel's apology.]]In &quot;Style Queen&quot;, Audrey mentions she was the one who discovered Gabriel, indicating that she was the one who introduced him to the fashion industry. She is furious when she learns that Gabriel has given her a second row seat instead of the first row. In &quot;[[Style Queen (Queen's Battle - Part 1)]]&quot;, she seeks revenge against him by attacking his son. However, after being deakumatized, she is approached by Gabriel who apologizes for the misunderstanding and is pleased when he says that only the front row is befitting for her, accepting the apology. After being impressed by [[Marinette]]'s work, she comments to Gabriel, &quot;I haven't felt this much emotion since... you&quot;.

===[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]]===
[[File:PigeonHat.png|thumb|Audrey impressed with Marinette's derby hat]]
Audrey does not know Marinette well, but she takes a liking to her when she sees the pigeon feather hat she created. She offers her a chance to move to New York City with her and become a famous fashion designer, though Marinette ultimately rejects the offer to stay in Paris. In &quot;[[Malediktator]]&quot;, Audrey is furious when Chloé tells her that Marinette got the entire class to gang up on her, calling her a monster.

== History ==
=== Season 2 ===
In &quot;[[Despair Bear]]&quot;, Audrey is pictured from Chloé's memory when Audrey is walking away from a sad young Chloé with a suitcase in hand, implying that she might have left the Bourgeois family.

In &quot;[[Frightningale]]&quot;, she was mentioned by Chloé when she threatened to call her mother if her father didn't cancel [[Clara Nightingale]]'s music video but she was then stopped by André, who said not to bother her with such little matters.

In &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot;, she was briefly mentioned by [[Sabrina Raincomprix]] regarding how she never remembers her daughter's birthdays.

In &quot;[[Style Queen (Queen's Battle - Part 1)|Style Queen]]&quot;, she returned to Paris to watch a &quot;[[Gabriel (brand)|Gabriel]]&quot; fashion show, but after being denied a front-row seat, she was [[Akumatization|akumatized]] into Style Queen, a glitter-themed villain. The first thing she did as Style Queen was turned [[Adrien Agreste]] into a glitter statue and then other spectators. When Chloé offers to be her assistant, Style Queen accepts but later turns her into a glitter statue when she catches her helping Ladybug. After being deakumatized, Audrey walked down the Eiffel Tower and back to the fashion show with Chloé. Despite Chloé's attempts to bond with her mother, Audrey dismisses her.

In &quot;[[Queen Wasp (Queen's Battle - Part 2)|Queen Wasp]]&quot;, after the events of &quot;Style Queen&quot;, she watches [[Gabriel Agreste]]'s fashion show. Afterward, she is approached by Gabriel himself, who apologizes for the misunderstanding and says that only the front row is befitting for Audrey Bourgeois. Audrey then notices [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]]'s [[Marinette's derby hat|hat]] and takes a liking to it, even offering her a chance to come with her to New York to become a famous fashion designer. When asked by Chloé why she was taking Marinette instead of her own daughter, Audrey said it was because Chloé wasn't exceptional like Marinette, angering her to the point where she revealed Pollen and the Bee Miraculous to be in her possession. After she transforms into Queen Bee and takes off, Audrey calls her daughter a showoff and later calls her out on her irresponsibility after a subway train incident, causing Chloé to become akumatized into Queen Wasp. Once deakumatized, Audrey announces on live TV that there is nothing exceptional about her daughter. However, thanks to Marinette, she later learns that she has a lot in common with her daughter, takes back her earlier comment, and embraces her. She decides to stay in Paris and be a part of Chloé's life.


In &quot;[[Malediktator]]&quot;, after hearing about Chloé's failed presentation, Audrey and Chloé demand that André close down the school and banish Marinette from Paris. When he cannot, she decides that they should move to New York instead and is annoyed when André refuses to come with them. When she and Chloé are confronted by Malediktator, Audrey tells her husband that getting himself akumatized does not make him a cool or hip father. While she rants, Malediktator turns her into a loving and devoted wife willing to stay in Paris with him. While under his spell, she constantly clings onto him affectionately and talks in a sweet tone. She takes a liking to the cat-like Cat Noir and begs Malediktator to let her keep him a little longer. After Malediktator's defeat, Audrey is turned back to normal and is furious with her husband for his actions, yet calms down when Chloé intervenes and suggests that they go home.

In &quot;[[Mayura]]&quot;, Audrey, along with her [[André Bourgeois|husband]] and [[Butler Jean|butler]], are preparing to leave Paris on the Bourgeois helicopter but they are struck by Dark Cupid's arrows, causing their emotions about Chloé being a superhero to become negative. She is akumatized into Scarlet Style Queen as a result and battles Queen Bee, along with Malediktator and Despair Bear.

===Season 3===
In &quot;[[Gamer 2.0]]&quot;,  Audrey was one of the many people taken captive by Gamer 2.0 and after Ladybug and Cat Noir defeat him she was set free.

* As seen in &quot;Style Queen&quot;, Audrey's phone number is '''+33642198'''.
* Interestingly, in [[Despair Bear]], it is implied that Audrey left [[André Bourgeois]] and Chloé. 
** However, in her debut episode, it is revealed that she just lives in New York most of the time.

'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;Told to admin Princess of Harte by the ML Tumblr on Miraculous Monday.&lt;/ref&gt; are [[Alya Césaire|Alya]]'s younger twin sisters.&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/cTfFWg__fvM&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[Sapotis]]&quot;, after being scolded by Alya and losing the opportunity to go to an amusement park for misbehaving, they are [[Akumatization|akumatized]] together by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Sapotis''', two monster [[Akumatized villains|supervillains]].

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Both Ella and Etta have tan skin, wavy brown hair that they put into low buns, and hazel eyes.

===Civilian attire===
Etta has teal earrings. She wears a pink and white-striped t-shirt, jean shorts with folded up legs, and pink sneakers with white laces and white toe tips.

Ella has pink earrings. She wears a teal and white-striped t-shirt, jean shorts with folded up legs, and teal sneakers with white laces and white toe tips.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Winny_BayDay/status/1098635398811734016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As Sapotis ===
Sapotis has smaller proportions, and she is red with two downward-bent lavender stripes on the top of her head. Two lavender ear-shaped ridges with black edges come out of each side of her head. Her eyes are lavender with pale yellow sclerae, and she has two pointy canines. Her feet are like hands, having opposable thumbs, and she has black claws. Additionally, she has two yellow golden bands around each wrist and ankle, and around her hips, she has a tutu-like object with two golden bands, the colors from the bands to the tips being red, lavender, and black.

== Personality ==
Ella and Etta are fun-loving, enthusiastic, and mischievous. They often speak in unison, and they while they usually get along, they sometimes argue with each other over things like their possessions.

Very energetic, they love messing around, and they leap onto [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] in excitement when he asks them where their house is in order to take them home. Disobedient at times, they enjoy causing trouble and blaming Sapotis for their behavior. However, they don't like being in trouble, and they cry when they are upset, like being devastated when Alya punishes them by telling them they won't get to go amusement park the next day.

As Sapotis, their mischief increases, happily breaking rules and causing mayhem across [[Paris]]. They enjoy eating, and they don't care for others' safety as long as their own selfish desires are being met. However, because of their obsession with fun, they easily fall for [[Alya Césaire|Rena Rouge]]'s illusion of an amusement park, ignoring Hawk Moth's warning that it is a trap.

They also tend to growl, which is especially noticable while they growl &quot;Miraculous&quot; while ganging up on Ladybug and Cat Noir.

== Abilities ==
=== As Sapotis ===
Sapotis has increased speed and dexterity with which to climb over anything. They can curl into balls, allowing them to tackle people with stronger impact. When they eat food, they multiply into more Sapotis, though these new ones will vanish when the propellers on their hats are removed.

* Ella's name is a reference to [[wikipedia:Ella Fitzgerald|Ella Fitzgerald]], and Etta's name is a reference to [[wikipedia:Etta James|Etta James]], just as the rest of her family's names are references to jazz singers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/MiraculousThomasAstruc/posts/1003852316417217&lt;/ref&gt;
* Their akumatized form was first revealed as silhouettes in a promotional poster on Jeremy Zag's Instagram.
* Both Etta and Ella have been akumatized at the same time since they are both holding onto the [[List of akumatized objects|object]] the akuma affects.
* As the term &quot;Sapotis&quot; is from a Créole legend that Ella and Etta pretend to be, Sapotis is one of the few villains Hawk Moth does not technically name.
* In one of Alya's instagram photos Ella and Etta have a teddy bear similar to Chloe's but in a different color.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' was a character from the old, unused concept of [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Félix Agreste|Cat Noir]] being in a team of superheroes called the [[Quantic Kids]]. He shows up in concept art with [[Melodie]] and [[Kid Mime]], who were members of the team. However, the concept was discarded, and so Gavroche never appeared outside concept art.&lt;ref&gt;http://bisexualvolpina.tumblr.com/post/154303411423/pictures-taken-from-the-ladybug-artbook-featuring&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoXav4p8zJ4&amp;lc=z124w3x4lnyvxzdrw04chzywfoqvjxsqohw (comment within discussion highlighted here)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is currently unknown if he exists in the [[Quantic Universe]].

== Appearance ==

=== Physical appearance ===
Based on concept art, in his civilian form, Gavroche had dark skin, dark brown hair, and golden brown eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wore a green flat cap with a white horizontal stripe towards the top and a white bill. He also wore a green jacket that had a white collar and dark gray pants. Around his neck, he had yellow-orange headphones.

=== As Gavroche ===
When in his costume, Gavroche wore silver goggles with black lines over the eyes and yellow-green lenses. He appears to have worn a green and white hoodie jacket, with the hood over his head and white stripes over his shoulders and around his hood. His hands were covered with white gloves.

== Sightings ==

=== Comics and books ===
{{AppearancesCB|LA = yes}}

== Trivia ==
* The name Gavroche is based on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavroche character of the same name] who appears in the novel ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables Les Misérables].''
* Gavroche's assumed civilian appearance has many similarities to [[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]]'s appearance, including skin color, eye color, and headphones worn around the neck.
** His superhero attire resembles Nino's as Carapace.

'''Vivica''' is an guitarist introduced in the [[Season 3|third season]] of ''[[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousINTL/status/1076099370427256832&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[Desperada]]&quot;, after being fired by [[Jagged Stone]] for eating his breakfast, she is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Desperada''', a musician-themed [[Akumatized villains|Supervillain]].

== Appearance ==
===Physical appearance===


===Civilian attire===


===As Desperada===

As Desperada she looks like a skeleton from the Day of the Dead festival with two musical notes that are on both sides of her cheek and has a star-shaped guitar case that she carries on her back.
== Personality ==


== Abilities ==
=== As Vivica ===
Vivica is a skilled guitarist. 

=== As Desperada ===
She can summon a variety of music-based weapons from her guitar case, transforming anyone who is hit by them into an imprint on the case. Her known weapons include:
* Trumpet: When she plays the trumpet it fires a blast of yellow energy that whenever it hit someone it'll transforms them into yellow dust.
* Guitar: She used a Guitar as a Medieval ax.
* Bicycle Horn: She used a pair of bicycle horns as pistols that also fired out yellow energy.
* Trombone: She used the trombone as a sniper rifle.

In addition to using these weapons, she's also able to concentrate on attacking multiple targets more than any other akumatized villains. However, she seems to concentrate more by someone strumming a stringed instrument, such as [[Luka Couffaine|Viperion]] strumming his [[Lyre]].

==Relationships==


==Sightings==
===Episodes===
{{AppearancesS3|GM2=yes|DE=yes}}

== Trivia ==
* Vivica is based on a real person of the same name. As the winner of a contest at the Miraculous Ladybug panel at Los Angeles Comic Con 2016, Vivica got to help create a future akumatized character during a visit at Zag Studios in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/ZRgqqo5TW7g&lt;/ref&gt;
** The real Vivica said she wanted to be a vet when she grew up, which is what inspired the character Vivica's job and akumatized form in early development, though it may have since changed.
* According to the whiteboard seen behind Jeremy Zag during the meeting for creating Vivica, Vivica might be a fan of [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] and feels like he doesn't get enough attention.&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/ZRgqqo5TW7g?t=150&lt;/ref&gt;
** Based on the whiteboard, either Hawk Moth, who &quot;knows Cat very well,&quot; might get jealous of Vivica or something else, or Vivica might become jealous and it leads to her akumatization.
* As of May 17, 2017, Vivica's episode has not been written; the French crew did not know about Vivica even being a character. Because [[Season 3]] was almost completely written, it is possible that Vivica will not be seen until Season 4 at the earliest if she still appears.&lt;ref&gt;Miraculous Meetup on May 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vivica later manages to debut in [[Desperada]].
** On June 3, 2018, [[Thomas Astruc]] noted that Vivica will still appear, but ideas from her development early on have changed.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/1003371036388331520&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vivica is the first character in the show to have braces.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a lacrosse player. In the story &quot;[[Miraculous Adventures Issue 1|Replay]]&quot; in [[Miraculous Adventures Issue 1|''Miraculous Adventures'']], when Adam gets upset at his team mates and [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]] at a lacrosse game, he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Replay''', a time-controlling [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Ladybug_Cartoon/status/856893215143841793&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Adam is an average height with tan skin, brown eyes, and brown hair with bangs brushed towards one side of his face.

=== Civilian attire ===
Adam wears green-tinted protective glasses and a blue jersey t-shirt with white lining, two white stripes around each sleeve, and a white 77 printed on the front. He also wears gray protective upper arm gear underneath his shirt, blue gloves, white jersey shorts with blue edges and two blue stripes around each sleeve, and white socks and sports shoes. He also has a watch on his left arm.

=== As Replay ===
Replay has blue skin and gray eyes. He wears a blue and yellow helmet that covers his entire head with a clear visor over his eyes, a triangular white section on the front, yellow fast-forward icon designs on the sides, and a red and yellow oval in the white section. He has his white shorts and lacrosse jersey, the latter turned into a sleeveless tank top, and he has blue gloves with yellow trimming that cover him up to his elbows. The watch is in the same place and over his glove.

== Personality ==

=== As Adam ===
Adam is dedicated to playing lacrosse, but he is also hot-tempered and quick to get frustrated with others. Easily upset, Adam strikes [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]] with his lacrosse stick after his team makes fun of him for missing a play. Additionally, Adam feels strongly about being respected, as he proclaims that it &quot;is not fair&quot; that his team teased him for his lacrosse skills despite Adam trying his best. However, after his akumatization and back at the game, Adam shows good sportsmanship, apologizing to Adrien and telling him &quot;good game&quot; even though his own team lost.

=== As Replay ===
Replay is proud, determined, and vengeful to those who bother him or offended him in his eyes. He finds amusement and power in being able to control others with his watch, but he also loses his temper easily at people who miss his watch's beams and undermine him. On occasion, Replay gets intimidated, surprised and nervous by Adrien's lacrosse joining up with him when he is about to attack Adrien.

== Abilities ==

=== As a civilian ===
Adam is skilled at playing lacrosse.

=== As Replay ===
[[File:Adventures_1_Watch_Use.png|thumb|Replay pausing and rewinding Chloé.]]
Replay possesses the power to alter the flow of time on objects and living beings around him using his stopwatch. By Replay pressing buttons on his watch, the watch shoots a yellow beam of light that can pause an object, rewind its actions, or fast forward its actions. For example, he uses the watch to pause and rewind [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]] when she confronts him, reversing her movements and forcing her back to her place.

However, the beam can be deflected using a mirror, and if the beam hits Replay, it has the same effect on him as it would have for his target.

== Relationships ==

=== [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien Agreste/Cat Noir]] ===
Adam greatly dislikes Adrien, placing some of the blame on him after he gets scolded by his team and given a five minute penalty. While being Replay, he attempts to get revenge on Adrien by rewinding a winning shot, but Adrien's team coming to his defense prevents Replay from fighting him. After being reverted back to normal and returning to the game, he treats Adrien kindly, apologizing for his past behavior and shaking hands with him to congratulate Adrien and his team's victory.

While being Replay, he despises Cat Noir and finds his antics annoying, wanting to pause Cat Noir's lips to make him stop talking.

{{Quote|Well, that would've never happened on ''my'' watch. I won't let anybody mess with my family.|Nora|&quot;[[Anansi]]&quot;}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://tvschedule.zap2it.com/overview.html?programSeriesId=SH02296324&amp;tmsId=SH022963240000&amp;from=sl&amp;aid=gapzap&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/978336355599208448&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Alya Césaire|Alya]]'s older sister and a kickboxer. In &quot;[[Anansi]]&quot;, she is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Anansi''', a spider-themed supervillain, when Alya refuses to listen to her overprotective advice.

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Nora is brown-skinned and muscular with golden brown hair. Her hair is tied into a ponytail. Nora's left eyebrow has what appears to be a scar going through it. She also has a beauty mark underneath her right eye.

=== Civilian attire ===
Nora wears a yellow cropped tank top with white edges with a black spider design on the front. White bandages wrap around her hands and wrists, and she wears black elbows pads. She also wears yellow shorts, which have a white upper band with the word &quot;Anansi&quot; written black capital letters on the front and two horizontal black lines wrapping around the rest, two black downward-bent lines on each side of the shorts, and white edges of the shorts' legs. Beneath her shorts are black short leggings.

=== As Anansi ===
Anansi has dark skin and yellow hair braided into a spiky ponytail. She has six eyes and they are white and are outlined in black. Her costume is black with yellow stripes. A black and yellow spider design is on her chest. She has six arms.

== Personality ==
Nora is strong and caring but also somewhat overprotective, especially when it comes to her family, believing only strength is needed to carry you through. She is also very confident in her fighting abilities and has little regards for superheroes, doubting they'll always be around to save everyone when there's danger. She also calls Alya's friends by nicknames, like calling [[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]] &quot;Cappie.&quot; Once she calms down, Nora can be humble when admitting defeat.

As Anansi, she is overconfident in her fighting abilities, believing it will always end in one punch and underestimates her opponents, whether it's civilians or superheroes. When angered, she is easily distracted and can lose her cool.




== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Nora is excellent at kick boxing. She is very fit and strong, easily able to defeat others in arm wrestling unless tricked.




{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;Stormy Weather 2&quot;, she is even strong enough to pick up and hold her sisters and Nino with ease.}}

=== As Anansi ===
Anansi can shoot webs from her mouth that she uses to trap people . She is shown to be able to climbs with her sticky grips . Because she is spider-themed villians , she has six arms and two legs. She also has immense strength.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Alya Césaire]] ===
Nora cares deeply about her younger sister, but sometimes that care leads her to be overly protective. She displays a great amount of concern for Alya's safety since she has been in direct danger from past akumatized villains and even tries to forbid her from going to the ferris wheel with her friends out of fear that an akumatized villain might attack her.

As Anansi, she does everything in her power to try and show Alya how dangerous [[Paris]] can be.

{{SpoilerButton}}
{{HideSpoiler|
=== [[Ella and Etta Césaire]] ===
Like Alya she cares deeply for her youngest sisters wanting to protect them from danger.}}

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
Nora is aware that Marinette is Alya's best friend calling her Baguette unknown to her that she helps Nino win the match. After she is deakumatized and Marinette tries to explain what happened Nora quickly forgives her.

As for Ladybug, Nora like the many people in Paris have heard of her and her heroism. And yet, she is doubtful that Ladybug would always be around forever or protect them. As Anansi she tries to steal her earrings. As time goes on she treats the heroine with respect and support seen during the events of &quot;Heroes' Day&quot;.

=== [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien Agreste/Cat Noir]] ===
Nora is aware that Adrien is Alya's friend calling him Cellphone Boy.

As for Cat Noir, Nora like the many people in Paris have heard of him and his heroism. And yet, she is doubtful that Cat Noir would always be around forever or protect them. As Anansi she tries to steal his ring. As time goes on she treats the hero with respect and support seen during the events of &quot;Heroes' Day&quot;.

=== [[Nino Lahiffe]] ===
When Nino tells Nora that he can protect Alya from danger, Nora laughs at him, believing that he is incapable of such a thing, though she does allow him to arm wrestle her to prove his worth. Though he wins the match (thanks to Marinette's help, unbeknowest to her), Nora insists that he cheated, finding it hard to believe that Nino could beat her. However, after being deakumatized, she apologizes for overreacting and spends time with him and the others at the ice rink. 

As Anansi, she constantly taunts him calling him weak. She even toys with him when he fights her using Cat Noir's staff but is angered when he lands a hit on her face.

== Trivia ==
* Nora's stage name and akumatized form, &quot;Anansi&quot;, comes from the [[Wikipedia:Anansi|African folktale character]] of the same name.
** In African folktales, Anansi often takes the shape of a spider and is considered to be the spirit of all knowledge of stories.
* Her character was officially introduced after [[Thomas Astruc]] designed her character and posted preliminary sketches of her on his Twitter on August 13, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/764534101298782208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/764539655412916224&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nora's existence was first teased in an earlier tweet by Thomas Astruc, where he asked the question, &quot;Afraid of spiders?&quot;, foreshadowing Nora's spider-themed akumatized form.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/754017692600901632&lt;/ref&gt;
* On a computer screen in a photo of production by [[Jeremy Zag]] on his Instagram, there is an unfinished reference model of Nora's civilian form.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BVhzJMGAgVU/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Thomas considers Nora his &quot;favorite girl&quot; as well as &quot;buff and beautiful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/978342324190236673&lt;/ref&gt;
* She calls people multiple nicknames:
** Cat Noir's nicknames are Cellphone Boy, Mr. Whiskers, and Kitten.
** Ladybug's nicknames are Beetle and Baguette.
** Hawk Moth's nicknames are Mothy, Butterfly Man, and Fly.
** Nino's nicknames are Cappie, Flyweight, and Lightweight.
*As a supervillain, Anansi is one of the few villains that Hawk Moth doesn't name, since &quot;Anansi&quot; is Nora's stage name in her boxing matches.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is [[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]]'s little brother, with whom Nino has a close bond.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
In &quot;[[Christmaster]]&quot;, after he begins to want Christmas to arrive immediately so that he can receive his gift, he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Christmaster''', a Christmas-themed [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].

{{HideSpoiler|
In &quot;[[Timetagger]]&quot;, a grown up Chris from the future is akumatized by [[Future Butterfly Miraculous holder|someone]] and becomes '''Timetagger''', a time travelling rapping supervillain, who comes to the present.}}

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Chris has light auburn hair, light brown eyes, and a light brown skin tone.

=== Civilian attire ===
Chris wears a light olive green shirt layered with a blue plaid flannel one. He also wears a pair of black frame glasses.

=== As Christmaster ===
He has white skin and red eyes and has a black and red jester-like Santa Claus hat and jester boots.

{{HideSpoiler|
=== As Timetagger ===
Timetagger has periwinkle skin, navy hair, and bright green eyes. Covering his eyes are green shades. He wears a black hoodie with sky blue edges, the hood over his head, and black sweatpants. Under the hood is a neon yellow visor, and on the back of the hoodie is a symbol depicting a clock. Around his neck, he has a gas mask colored sky blue and neon yellow and a yellow chain necklace with a clock on it. He wears high-top shoes that are mainly black with yellow laces and have blue symbols on them.}}

== Personality ==
Chris is small and funny&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;[https://twitter.com/Miraculous_US/status/864927538765676544 Twitter account Miraculous_US recording information from the May 17 event.] ([https://youtu.be/tBGO07cb0Aw?t=1508 exact moment here])&lt;/ref&gt;. He considers himself a big boy, that's why he is capricious and rebellious when Marinette wants to play with him with toys, making him extremely hard to get along with. Despite having a lot of toys, he thinks dolls are for small children, and his toys are different. For this reason, he does not like to watch cartoons intended for younger people and protests when someone says he is too young to play certain games. However the boy is highly curious, hinted by how excited he is at the gifts that Marinette hides from him. He can be skeptical, but if someone doesn't admit to lying after he calls them out, he is quick to believe them. This is shown when he does not believe in the words of Marinette that she is Santa's elf, but believes it soon after calling her out, hoping that the girl will get the perfect gift for him. He hates the term love and thinks it's horrible, but he also knows how to be polite, greeting Ladybug while Cat Noir takes him away.

As Christmaster, he is very greedy and fond of his toys, and is willing to give up his akuma for them.

{{HideSpoiler|
As Timetagger, he is incredibly arrogant and conceited in his own abilities, and is fond of taunting his enemies. He shows little to no concern about how his actions will affect others or history in general, sending people back in time at random and even tormenting Bunnix by banishing her to various different time periods. He is even willing to manipulate Hawk Moth as part of his scheme, making him believe that he was sent by his future counterpart to get the [[Ladybug Miraculous|Ladybug]] and [[Cat Miraculous|Cat]] Miraculouses for him in the past, only to double-cross him by revealing that he wasn't the one who sent him at all.}}

== Relationships ==
=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] ===
In “Christmaster”, Chris was being babysat by Marinette and gets annoyed when she suggests that he play with his toys rather than video games, insisting that he is a big boy. He notices that Marinette has several presents hidden in her room and asks about it, only for Marinette to lie and claim that she is one of Santa’s elves. He is upset with her when he learns the truth, though he quickly forgives her but is disgusted to learn that the presents she hid are for a boy.

=== [[Nino Lahiffe]] ===
Not much is known about Chris’ relationship with his brother, but Nino does care about him as he shows concern for Chris when he appears sad after being at Marinette’s house and later on when he is akumatized.

{{HideSpoiler|
=== [[Lila Rossi]] ===
In “Timetagger”, when Lila babysits Chris and tells him that she invented the game Freestyle Clash, Chris is amazed by this and calls her cool, unaware that she was lying.}}

== Abilities ==
=== As Christmaster ===
Wields a magic snow globe that, when a toy touches it, gives the toys life, increased size, and powers and abilities of Christmaster's choosing.

Seemingly his toys can have powers and/or abilities related to what the toy is based on. A toy dog has smelling abilities of a real dog, a toy catfish can swim through the air, and [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] dolls have [[Lucky Charm]] and [[Cataclysm]], respectively. The Ladybug and Cat Noir toys also can use their powers seemingly with no limit.

{{HideSpoiler|
=== As Timetagger ===
With his spray can gun, Timetagger can shoot a beam that sends anyone to a time period of his choosing, with his actions often altering history as a result, such as making [[Xavier Ramier|Mr. Ramier]] a famous knight in the 15th century with a statue of him built outside the [[Louvre]], ancient paintings of Jagged Stone and Nadja Chamack in the paintings and a stone image of Ancient Egypt about Mayor Bourgeois etc. When the beam he shoots does not hit a person, graffiti will appear on the object it hits instead, and he can use his powers to travel between the spots that he has sprayed in a manner that mimics teleportation.}}

== Trivia ==
* In the French version, Chris is named Noël.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
** Since his debut episode was planned as a Christmas special, the different name is apparently intended to match the episode's name with the holiday theme.
** This follows suit on the wordplay of [[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]]'s name with ''[[wikipedia:Nolife (TV channel)|Nolife]]''.
* He is possibly friends with [[Manon Chamack]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* He is the first akumatized victim that willingly gives his akumatized object to Ladybug.
* He's the sixth child to be akumatized, following Manon Chamack, [[August]], [[Ella and Etta Césaire]] and [[Unnamed boy]].
** Additionally, Christmaster's powers are similar to the Puppeteer's, for they both bring toys to life with an akumatized object used to control them.
{{HideSpoiler|
* He is the first known akumatized villain that was akumatized by the [[Future Butterfly Miraculous holder]].
* Timetagger is the third akumatized villain to have time-related powers after Timebreaker and Backwarder.}}

The '''fisherman''' is a man who likes to fish at the [[Seine]]. In the [[Miraculous Adventures|''Miraculous Adventures'']] story &quot;[[Miraculous Adventures Issue 2|Trash Krakken Part 1]]&quot;, after having a lousy day of fishing, he gets [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Silurus''', a water and catfish-controlling [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].

The fisherman wears a khaki fishing hat, a plain white shirt, and green pants. He also wears a khaki vest with four pockets on the chest, dark green pants that are tucked below his brown boots which go below his knees.

=== As Silurus ===
He has chartreuse-colored skin, and his eyes are solid pale yellow. His suit is turquoise around the torso with three chartreuse spots and dark blue in the forearms and legs from his waist to his feet. The suit covers the top half of his face with a dark blue mask, and two catfish-like whiskers protrude from his cheekbones. At the top of his head, the suit has a chartreuse crest, and it has a fin on the back as well.

== Personality ==

=== As a civilian ===
The fisherman is fine overall, but he can lose his patience when dealing with disappointing situations, upset about being unable to catch any fish and getting splashed because of a beach ball.

=== As Silurus ===
As Silurus, he is vengeful, proud, and furious. He strongly believes that the Seine is only meant for fishing, not for other leisure activities like swimming. Angry about the civilians ruining his fishing by scaring off the fish, he lashes back at them with catfish and his [[List of akumatized objects|fishing rod]], even willing to drown his foes. Silurus also has little patience for those ruining his schemes, getting enraged at [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] for trying to get rid of his catfish.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
The fisherman is skilled at fishing.

=== As Silurus ===
Silurus can control the water and catfish. He holds himself high above the river and travels around with a waterspout. With voice commands and gestures, he controls the catfish to go out in any direction and/or attack anyone he desires. Also, Silurus is able to create catfishes comprised out of water for crashing into opponents. However, a strong enough blow, like from [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]]'s [[yo-yo]] or Cat Noir's [[Cataclysm]], can destroy his waterspout or water-formed catfishes, His fishing rod is his tool for hitting targets, like humans and objects, or hooking them to pull them towards him or yank them into the water. The rod is able to hook onto his water-formed catfishes as well.

== Trivia ==
* Silurus' name is taken from ''[[wikipedia:Silurus|Silurus]]'', the genus of catfishes that are native to Europe and Asia.
* Silurus' abilities are similar to [[Xavier Ramier|Mr. Pigeon]] in that they both have the power to control a particular animal species.
** However, unlike Mr. Pigeon, Silurus can control water as well.

{{Chloe Quote}}
'''Chloé Bourgeois''' is a student in [[Miss Bustier's class]] at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]] and the rival of [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]]. She is also the daughter of [[André Bourgeois]] and [[Audrey Bourgeois]]. 

In &quot;[[Antibug]]&quot;, after [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] ignores her suggestions on how to beat [[Sabrina Raincomprix|Vanisher]] and calls her a liar, Chloé is [[Akumatization|infected]] with an [[akuma]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and becomes '''Antibug''', a [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]] that has the same outfit and the same abilities as Ladybug. 

In &quot;[[Style Queen (Queen's Battle - Part 1)|Style Queen]]&quot;, after Ladybug loses the [[Bee Miraculous]] that she wants to entrust to [[Alya Césaire]], Chloé finds the [[Bee Miraculous]] and she, when the Miraculous is inhabited by [[Pollen]], becomes '''Queen Bee''' ('''Queen B'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Pandasuite&quot;&gt;https://pandasuite.com/viewer/2.0.2/59a6c26e48abe6f53a002dc9?t=1 (direct video source [https://data.pandasuite.com/videos/59a3e7def643f27d7300131b-universal_1024_1024_20_main_3-0.mp4 here])&lt;/ref&gt; in the French version), a bee-themed superhero who helps Ladybug and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] &quot;during particularly difficult missions&quot; in the second season.&lt;ref name=&quot;YT QueenBee&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/vtO8bbvmU0g?t=1586&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;http://tvmag.lefigaro.fr/programme-tv/miraculous-les-secrets-de-la-saison-2-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir_d32cc720-a2c3-11e7-b619-f944cd28c6f6/&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in &quot;[[Queen Wasp (Queen's Battle - Part 2)|Queen Wasp]],&quot; after a failed attempt at trying to impress her [[Audrey Bourgeois|mother]], Chloé is once again akumatized by Hawk Moth and becomes '''Queen Wasp''', a wasp-themed villain. In &quot;[[Mayura (Heroes' Day - Part 2)|Mayura]]&quot;, during the fight with Scarlet Moth, Queen Bee is akumatized into a scarlet version of Queen Wasp.

As of &quot;[[Miraculer]]&quot;, Ladybug will no longer call upon Chloé to be Queen Bee due to the risk her identity being public knowledge places upon both Chloé and her family. 

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;[[Miracle Queen (Battle of the Miraculous - Part 2)|Miracle Queen]]&quot;, Chloé gets akumatized into '''Miracle Queen''', a controlling themed villain where she is to set in motion for Hawk Moth's &quot;elaborate mortal plan&quot;.}}

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Chloé stands at medium height with light honey blonde hair that is pulled back into a high ponytail and light ocean blue eyes. 

=== Civilian attire ===
She is mostly seen wearing makeup; light blue eye-shadow, nude lipstick, and a light peach-colored blush. For accessories, she has a gold chain necklace, with a gold sphere charm. She also has white-rimmed sunglasses on her head. Additionally, she wears a yellow long-sleeved jacket over a white shirt with black stripes around the waist. The rest of her outfit includes white jean capris with a belt that has diamond-shaped studs and white dress shoes with black lining and soles. 

=== As Queen Bee ===
[[File:QB Transform -2.gif|thumb|left|200px]]
Queen Bee wears a yellow and black domino mask. She wears her hair back in a ponytail which is curled to resemble a bee's stinger at the ends, tied with a black hairband, with two black antennae-like ribbons sticking out from the hairband, and a streak of black hair curled into her ponytail. The Bee Miraculous comb is placed in the upper right side of her head next to the hairband. Queen Bee wears a yellow costume made up of many tiny hexagonal patterns to resemble a honeycomb with three black stripes on her torso and two on the upper thigh. Her upper rib cage is covered by black. The sleeves of the costume are also black, which end in gloves with yellow fingers. Her black boots go down the length of her lower legs, starting directly below the second stripe on her thigh, and ending with yellow wedges. She has her weapon, the [[Spinning top|spinning top]], tied around her waist. The similarities between her and Ladybug's suit designs could be an allusion to her adoration of the latter.

=== As Antibug ===
Antibug wears a costume similar to Ladybug's, but it has inverted colors. Her hair remains in a ponytail rather than pigtails.

=== As Queen Wasp ===
Queen Wasp looks similar to Queen Bee, but with inverted colors, blackish-gray hair with a yellow band going through. She also has magenta eyes and yellow skin.

== Personality ==
[[File:OR1-(257).png|thumb|Chloé forces Marinette out of her seat.]]
Chloé is a spoiled, arrogant, and superficial girl who does everything in her power to crush and humiliate the other students, especially [[Marinette]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://imgur.com/a/iU8ip ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Qry0SBvmdNZjBrckwxb1Y4TU0/view?pli=1 English translation])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Qry0SBvmdNZjBrckwxb1Y4TU0/view?pli=1&lt;/ref&gt; Chloé believes that she is the most important person in the world and everyone adores her, but the real reason why she acts like this is because her [[André Bourgeois|father]] is the mayor of [[Paris]] and he constantly spoils her by giving her everything she wants. She thinks highly of herself and lowly of others as she believes that she deserves everything and takes pride in her rich lifestyle. If there is something that she wants, like [[Adrien Agreste]]'s attention or revenge against Marinette, she will do anything, including underhanded actions, to succeed. She steals [[Marinette's derby hat|Marinette's derby hat design]] to humiliate her and impress Adrien and [[Gabriel Agreste]] in &quot;[[Mr. Pigeon]]&quot;, and she threatens [[Mr. Damocles]] into punishing [[Alya Césaire]] by calling her father in &quot;[[Lady Wifi]]&quot;. Her sour attitude comes across openly to whatever and whoever she despises, but she will sometimes pretend to be innocent and emotionally distressed to manipulate others. She rarely treats any of her peers respectfully, she is even bossy and overbearing to her best friend [[Sabrina Raincomprix]] and claims to her [[Audrey Bourgeois|mother]] that she is just using her in &quot;Queen Wasp&quot;.

[[File:RC_S01EP09_(53).png|thumb|left|Chloé insults Marinette.]] 
While being callous and careless to anyone but herself, Chloé can be cowardly. She is easily scared of danger often caused by akumatized villains. Having helped caused some people to be akumatized, Chloé, to her horror and confusion, finds herself their victim for revenge. Despite some of the villains calling her out for her nasty behavior, Chloé disagrees with them, believing she is good. She remains awful most of the time, but occasionally, she shows a bit more kindness, sometimes expressing happiness when Ladybug is saving her or expressing it towards Sabrina. She also listens to advice at rare moments, like following Ladybug's suggestion to reconcile with Sabrina in &quot;Antibug&quot;. She has a fierce temper when angered as seen in several episodes and sometimes acts a little bit like a child or a daddy's girl. Her perceived childishness can be observed in &quot;[https://miraculousladybug.fandom.com/wiki/Antibug Antibug]&quot;, in which she displays her affinity for playing what can be considered childish, roleplaying games with Sabrina. This, though, could just as easily be a representation of her adoration for Ladybug.

On occasions, Chloé can be courageous as she is willingly helpful when asked by those she is close to or admires like Ladybug or Adrien, such as helping Ladybug defeat the [[Butler Jean|villain]] in &quot;[[Despair Bear]]&quot;. If requested for a purpose, particularly by Adrien so that she can still be friends with him, she knows how to act congenial around others, although she often comes off as forced and can't keep it up for long.

[[File:Miraculous_Season_2_Sneak_Peak_(31).png|thumb|Chloé tries (but fails) to be nicer to her classmates.]]
Also on rare occasions, Chloé can be remorseful towards her actions, seen in &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot;, when she apologizes to [[Caline Bustier|Miss Bustier]] about forgetting her birthday and that her lashing out in anger caused trouble for everyone. After being deakumatized in &quot;[[Queen Wasp (Queen's Battle - Part 2)|Queen Wasp]]&quot;, she sincerely apologizes to Ladybug and Cat Noir for selfishly using her superpowers and for what happened to Pollen because of her actions.

[[File:AudreyAndChloe.png|thumb|left|Chloé attempts to bond with her mother by making fun of Marinette’s hat.]]
Much of Chloé's current personality is a result of her feeling unloved by Audrey as she keeps forgetting Chloé's name and her father's spoiling. Chloé desperately wanted to be appreciated by Audrey by trying to give her a gift and following her around and copying her moves to bond, albeit failing. At the end of “Style Queen”, Chloé attempted to ask her mother to spend time together, only to be dismissed. In “Queen Wasp”, Chloé was very hurt after her mother dismisses her as irresponsible for the subway train incident and after being deakumatized, when she hugged onto the Bee Miraculous in anguish after hearing her mother reprimand her, desperately begging Ladybug for a second chance. At the end of “Queen Wasp”, Chloé sadly asks her mother why she did not love her, to which Audrey hesitantly replied that she did. Once both of them found out their similarities of subjecting others and love for ordering others around thanks to Marinette, they hugged each other and Audrey decides to spend more time with Chloé in Paris. She did not care about hiding her superhero identity, revealing Pollen to the public and transforming in front of everyone to show them, especially her mother, that she was exceptional because she could become a hero. It is also hinted that despite her proud façade, Chloé feels insecure, and describes herself as &quot;worthless&quot; to Ladybug in &quot;[https://miraculousladybug.fandom.com/wiki/Malediktator Malediktator]&quot;.

In &quot;Animaestro&quot;, Chloé's attempts to be a better person continue. When working together with Marinette, Chloé found out she had a crush on Adrien but decided not to tell because she thought it was a waste of time, with that being her way of being nice, proving that both Adrien's and Marinette's words left an imprint on her.

{{HideSpoiler|Also, in “Stormy Weather 2”, when she insulted Aurore and it led her to be akumatized, Chloé waited for Ladybug to give her the Bee Miraculous, showing she wanted to fix her mistake.}}

[[File:QueenBeeLadybug.jpg|thumb|Queen Bee is excited at getting a chance to work with Ladybug.]]
As Queen Bee, she is proud of her abilities and wanted to prove herself to her mother by causing a subway train to go at dangerous speeds to save it so the civilians will be grateful towards her. She wanted to be a famous, well-known, and well-liked hero just like Ladybug, so she calls [[Nadja Chamack]] to film her saving the said subway train. However, in &quot;Malediktator&quot;, after a talk with Ladybug, Chloé tearfully reveals that she is aware that no one in her class really likes her and she feels useless. When given the [[Bee Miraculous]] by Ladybug, she heroically helps her defeat the titular villain and gives back the Miraculous without hesitation. Afterward, she slowly attempts to be a better person by cleaning up her own lair instead of having her butler do it and she is happy that everyone at school is throwing her a party in honor of her saving Paris.

Similar to Cat Noir, Queen Bee has a bit of a habit of leaping before she looks, meaning she is hasty or quick to act seen in &quot;Catalyst&quot;, where she was eager to fight against Hawk Moth's army or in &quot;Malediktator&quot;, where she quickly apologized to her father instead of listening to Ladybug's plan first. 

In &quot;Miraculer&quot;, Chloé's personality shows a new, loyal, and dedicated side. Despite her mounting frustration with Ladybug, when Hawk Moth tries to akumatize her, she does what nobody in the series has done before: say no to him.

As Antibug, most of Chloé's personality remains the same except that she is more vengeful towards Ladybug. She enjoys taunting her and Cat Noir about their teamwork, believing she is weak without him and Cat Noir is playing second fiddle.

As Queen Wasp, Chloé is prideful and arrogant towards Cat Noir and Ladybug, believing herself to be a more exceptional hero worthy of her mother's praise than both of them. She also wants to prove herself by taking away their Miraculouses and feels angry towards everyone who dislikes her and paralyzes them.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
[[File:DB_S01EP12_(224).png|thumb|left|Chloé vows to ruin Marinette’s reputation.]]
Chloé, having grown up in politics due to her father's position, knows how to cheat, manipulate, fool, and humiliate others for her own personal success. If she has a goal in mind, she will do whatever it takes to achieve it, even if it means sabotaging others and bringing them down. In &quot;[[Mr. Pigeon]]&quot;, she wants to earn Adrien's attention, so she plagiarizes Marinette's hat and passes it off as her own, though Marinette is able to prove that the derby hat is her design. In &quot;[[Reflekta]]&quot;, she tells [[Sabrina]] to lock [[Juleka Couffaine|Juleka]] in the bathroom just so that she can stand next to [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]] in the class photo. Chloé is also a skilled dancer as revealed in &quot;[[Frightningale]]&quot; due to eight years of practice.

=== As Queen Bee ===
[[File:Venom_Sequence_(15).png|thumb|Queen Bee calls upon her superpower Venom.]]
Queen Bee has enhanced physical capabilities and is quite flexible and agile, easily able to do a backflip from the floor to the top of the stage. However, she is not strong enough to stop a subway train by herself, requiring both Cat Noir and Ladybug's help. She can yank the pull string on her [[Spinning top]] to send it onto the ground and letting it spin, which then allows her travel with it by either riding it or letting the top pull her. Using her top, she can travel much faster than Ladybug and can reach her destination much quicker than other Miraculous holders. She can also use her weapon to attack and protect. Her superpower, [[Venom]], allows her to use the top as a stinger, immobilizing her target for a set amount of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;winny interview&quot;&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CtT7pI95GLNLz2xYT5gw1IHAFaB8O6n6cosXZVOK7N4/mobilebasic&lt;/ref&gt;
As Queen Bee, she is skilled in hand to hand combat.

=== As Antibug ===
[[File:Antibug_(1110).png|thumb|left|Antibug wields her Anti-Charm weapon.]]
Antibug has the same abilities as Ladybug, including enhanced strength and agility. She has her own yo-yo, which she prefers to mostly use offensively. Also, like Ladybug having [[Lucky Charm]], Antibug has her own special superpower to summon objects called &quot;Anti-Charm.&quot; Unlike Lucky Charm, which gives Ladybug random, inherently normal objects, Anti-Charm gives Antibug a weapon, like a large and bulky sword. However, she shares the same time limit to her transformation after using her superpower.

=== As Queen Wasp ===
[[File:QueenWasp.png|thumb|Queen Wasp calls upon her paralytic wasps.]]
As an akumatized Miraculous holder, Queen Wasp is considerably powerful, able to summon swarms of wasps and direct them. Like her original superpower Venom, Queen Wasp can use her wasps to sting her targets and immobilize them indefinitely, unlike Venom which can only be used once. She can form her wasps into different shapes and forms such as arrows, rockets, binoculars, and telescopes. She can also ride on her wasps by letting them carry her. However, her wasps have a weakness and dislike for water, avoiding their target if they manage to go underwater.

== Trivia ==
* The name '''Chloé''' means &quot;blooming&quot; and &quot;fertility&quot;.
** The name '''Chloé''' also can mean from both ancient Greek and biblical origins. In Greek, the name is closely related to the goddess Demeter and represents fertility and fresh blooming. In the Christian bible, the name means &quot;green herb.&quot;
* Chloé's surname '''Bourgeois''' is a French term that is used to describe a member of the middle class within France. 
** The fact that she looks down on people who aren't as popular or rich as her is a reference to this.
* In earlier concept art of Chloé, she doesn't have her hair in a ponytail. She wears a purple vest with a diamond pattern around the waist, a white long-sleeve shirt, and blue jeans. &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/757503403736064001&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Miraculous Fashion show concept.png|thumb|180px|Chloé (right) with Alya (left) and Marinette (middle) in a concept art.]]
** This is very similar to [[Sabrina Raincomprix]]'s current outfit.
** Also, in one concept art, Chloé is watching a fashion show with [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] and [[Alya Césaire]], suggesting that she may have been friends with them in an earlier concept.
** A later concept art design for Chloé included a white cardigan with a black edge, white shorts with black stripes, and high white boots with black edges and soles.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Old Classroom Photo concept.png|Image]] from the [https://youtu.be/qpDCWD5G2jU 2014 Licensing Show Video].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Astruc]] explained at Mangafest in Spain that Chloé was intentionally created since the beginning to be as unpleasant as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;mangafest 2017&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/ladybugspain/status/937213835852869632&lt;/ref&gt;
* Originally, Chloé and [[Sabrina Raincomprix|Sabrina]] were supposed to be in a trio with [[Alix Kubdel|Alix]], which was a reference to the trio Sam, Clove, and Alex in ''Totally Spies!''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/674293643944067072&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chloé's character description on the official Miraculous Ladybug website states that she is Marinette's &quot;greatest frenemy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miraculousladybug.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chloé was the only friend [[Adrien Agreste]] had before he started attending public school.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
* Some of Chloé's Ladybug paraphernalia can be seen in her locker in “[[The Evillustrator]]”
* She likes to order sushi and she hates pizza, as noted in “[[Princess Fragrance]]&quot;.
** She also dislikes soup, as she states in &quot;[[Kung Food]]&quot;.
* She appears as Antibug in the theme song animatic.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAYE2FW9aKs&amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/ref&gt;
* Like [[Théo Barbot|Copycat]] with Cat Noir and [[Lila Rossi|Volpina]] with the [[Ancient Chinese Fox Miraculous holder|Fox Miraculous holder]], Antibug is a copy of a [[Miraculous holders|Miraculous holder]]. However, her appearance and superpower, Anti-Charm, are the opposite of Ladybug's.
* In &quot;[[Antibug]]&quot;, it is hinted that Chloé is seen to be a left-handed person.
* A lot more information about Chloé, such as her backstory, will be revealed and expanded upon in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/796808815379447808&lt;/ref&gt;
** Particularly, the &quot;drums and kisses&quot; episode will be a first step to learning more about Chloé. &lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CtT7pI95GLNLz2xYT5gw1IHAFaB8O6n6cosXZVOK7N4/mobilebasic&lt;/ref&gt;
*** This episode is later to be revealed to be &quot;Zombizou&quot;, it is then followed by &quot;Style Queen&quot;, &quot;Queen Wasp&quot;, and &quot;Malediktator&quot;.
* According to Sabrina in &quot;Zombizou,&quot; Chloé never remembers people's birthday, just like her mother.
** She also doesn't like birthdays due to sole reason.
* In the future, according to Thomas, Chloé will not end up in a romantic relationship, but her relationship with Sabrina will improve a lot.&lt;ref name=&quot;mangafest 2017&quot; /&gt;
* Following [[Alya Césaire]] and [[Nino Lahiffe]], Chloé is the third person become to a Miraculous holder and akumatized villain, excluding [[Gabriel Agreste]], who akumatized himself.
** She is the third person to be akumatized for the second time following [[Alix Kubdel]] and [[Ivan Bruel]].
*** However, she’s the first person to be akumatized for a second time with a new identity and powers while being in her superhero form.
[[File:Bee_superhero_concept.png|thumb|Queen Bee's first appearance in the MIFA's 30th-anniversary image.]]
* Queen Bee's existence was first revealed in 2015 in an illustration by [[wikipedia:Zagtoon|ZAG]] celebrating MIFA's 30th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.annecy.org/resources/images/2015_30ans_mifa_method_animation_hd.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;
** The character was eventually confirmed to be Queen Bee during the Miraculous Ladybug panel at the 2016 [[wikipedia:San Diego Comic Con|San Diego Comic-Con]].&lt;ref name=&quot;YT QueenBee&quot;/&gt;
* She was later teased in a concept poster for the &quot;ZAG Heroez&quot; franchise that [[Jeremy Zag]] posted on his Instagram, the poster showing her lower body and legs.&lt;ref name=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BJH34PxAOi-/&lt;/ref&gt;
** She was teased again by Jeremy Zag in a three-second storyboard video.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BJR0opQgY40/&lt;/ref&gt;
** The finished version of Queen Bee for the ZAG Heroez poster was released by Jeremy on Instagram, showing Queen Bee's face. He also tagged the image with #queenbee, suggesting that Queen Bee might be her name.&lt;ref name=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BKytMiJAYwj/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Her identity was later revealed to be Chloé at a Miraculous panel at New York Comic Con 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* Queen Bee's design changed in many ways from the earliest known concept art of her.
** She didn't tie up her hair as she lets it hang loosely and she had bangs.
** She had a black and yellow striped round cap on the side of her head from which protruded two antennae.
** Her hands were covered with yellow gloves, with the black sleeves ending at a point at the center of the front and back of them.
** The top part of her torso--including her upper arms--was fuzzy.
** She had a circular, yellow with black circles purse around her waist.
* According to a synopsis on Le Figaro, [[Wang Fu]] will call on Queen Bee.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* [[Wilfried Pain]] commented in an interview that knowing Chloé, she will be showing off a lot as Queen Bee.&lt;ref name=&quot;winny interview&quot; /&gt;
* Queen Wasp was first revealed on August 31, 2017, at a TFOU press conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pandasuite&quot;/&gt;
* Queen Wasp appears in the trilogy, &quot;The Queen's Battle&quot;, along with two other villains: [[Audrey Bourgeois|Style Queen]] and [[André Bourgeois|Malediktator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pandasuite&quot;/&gt;
* Queen Wasp is another akumatized villain to be based off of a [[Miraculous holders|Miraculous holder]], previous times being with [[Théo Barbot|Copycat]], Antibug and [[Lila Rossi|Volpina]].
** All of Chloé's akumatizations so far are based on superheroes (Antibug/Ladybug and Queen Wasp/Queen Bee).
* Chloé is the first Miraculous wielder shown not to maintain a secret identity onscreen.
* In the Slovenian dub, her name is changed to '''Clara Bourgeois'''.
* Chloé is the second known person after Gabriel to have a Miraculous that wasn't meant for her. But unlike Gabriel, who uses the Butterfly Miraculous evilly, Chloé uses the Bee Miraculous to become a superhero.
* As of &quot;Miraculer,&quot; Chloé is the first person to be able to successfully resist Hawk Moth's akumatization.
* Chloé has her own official Instagram account. You can find her under nick [https://www.instagram.com/theofficialchloebourgeois/ @theofficialchloebourgeois].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/1152334692370309128&lt;/ref&gt;
** She mentions that she used to do ballet when she was younger.
** Her signature color is canary yellow.
** She aspires to be a fashion queen like her mother and gets her looks from her too. 
{{HideSpoiler|
* She is tied with Alya as they are the only ones of the French Miraculous superhero team to be akumatized the most with a total of four times.
* Like Gabriel, Chloé too will no longer be Queen Bee in the future by succeeded but [[Future Queen Bee|someone else]].}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a man who lives in [[New York City|New York]] with his daughter [[Kenya]]. As established in &quot;[[Miraculous Adventures Issue 4]]&quot;, after coming into contact with mysterious [[Unnamed black substance|black goo]] while retrieving his daughter's favorite toy, [[Mr. Squid]], he transforms into the '''Trash Krakken''', a giant destructive monster.

== Appearance ==
=== Physical Appearance ===
Kenya's father has brown skin, light brown eyes and light brown hair.

=== As Trash Krakken ===
The Trash Krakken is made out of mud and trash. It has lime green eyes, a huge slimy, green body with various types of objects absorbed onto its body, multiple tentacles that are dangling on its back, and large pointy teeth sticking out of its mouth.

== Personality ==
[[File:Kenya's father - Photograph.png|thumb|left|A photo of Kenya and her father.]]
The father is loving and compassionate, willing to go into the sewers to find his daughter's precious toy.

As the Trash Krakken, he is mindless but ferocious, creating damage everywhere and lashing back at anything it considers a threat. 

== Abilities ==
=== As a villain ===
The Trash Krakken can dig into the earth, creating a huge crack within New York City. Like a &quot;living quicksand,&quot; it absorbs anything that it comes into contact with, from trees and banana peels to human beings, and it is invulnerable to a wide variety of attacks. It can also attack others with its tentacles, which, like the rest of its body, absorb what they touch.

== Trivia ==
* A van that closely resembles the Mystery Machine from the ''[[Wikipedia:Scooby-Doo|Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise is seen stuck in the Trash Krakken's body in the third issue.
* The Trash Krakken is similar to an [[Akumatized villains|akumatized villain]], being a regular person transformed by an [[List of akumatized objects|infected object]] into a super-powered being or creature. However, the origin of the goo that covered Mr. Squid is unknown.

{{SpoilerButton}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;http://metawohoo.tumblr.com/post/148541108709/i-got-my-copy-of-un-chat-de-trop-and-the-actual&lt;/ref&gt; is an artist and a sculptor. In &quot;[[Copycat]]&quot;, when [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] doesn't attend the unveiling of his [[Ladybug's and Cat Noir's sculpture|statue]] of her and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]], he becomes frustrated. When Cat Noir claims to &quot;have a thing&quot; with Ladybug, Théo also becomes jealous and gets [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into Copycat, a doppelganger of Cat Noir.

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Théo is a bit taller than Adrien, with brown hair tied up in a bun, brown eyes, and a soul patch. 

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a purple shirt with two unbuttoned buttons at the top, a black overshirt, gray jeans, and black boots.

=== As Copycat ===
Copycat looks the exact same as Cat Noir, including his physical features.

== Personality ==
Théo is creative and gracious. He appreciates Ladybug for protecting Paris; he's sure they have a lot in common. Though more on the quiet side, he has a lot of passion for his work and the things he cares about. He has feelings for Ladybug and he takes it hard when she doesn't show up for the reveal of his statue. He also gets easily jealous when Cat Noir brags about he and Ladybug being a couple, claiming that Cat Noir isn't good enough for her. However, after he is reverted back to his normal self, he gets over his frustration and jealousy, appreciating Ladybug signing his photo of her and at peace about Cat Noir and Ladybug being together--not knowing that it isn't the case.

As Copycat, he is overcome by his jealousy of Cat Noir and admiration of Ladybug. He makes a bad name for Cat Noir by stealing the Mona Lisa from the Louvre and he captures Cat Noir and attempts to trick Ladybug into thinking that he is the real Cat Noir, in hopes of achieving her affection. When he isn't able to fool Ladybug, he shouts that no one will have her and attacks Cat Noir. While cunning and determined, he falls for Ladybug's trick of asking him about their secret promise that they never made, which he thinks they have.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
[[File:CC (139).png|thumb|left|Théo's statue of Ladybug and Cat Noir.]]
Théo is a very skilled artist, being able to make a very realistic bronze statue of Ladybug and Cat Noir (although, according to the latter, he should be taller). Also, Théo is able to do a wide variety of jobs, such as being a furniture mover and a boom operator, as seen in multiple cameos.

=== As Copycat ===
&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; crop=&quot;true&quot; widths=&quot;250px&quot;&gt;

CC (525).png|Copycat's ring, losing a pad after using Cataclysm.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Copycat, being [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir's]] doppelganger, possesses supernatural strength and agility, along with having a copy of Cat Noir's [[staff]] and being able to use [[Cataclysm]]. However, using Cataclysm makes him start running out of energy, which is shown by his ring losing paw prints, just as it does for the real Cat Noir. He can also mimic Cat Noir's voice.

{{Clear}}
== Relationships ==
=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] ===
Théo has a crush on Ladybug, inspired by her heroism and admiring her greatly. However, he is upset when Ladybug doesn't show up to the reveal of the statue he designed, and he becomes determined to win her over after becoming akumatized as Copycat. He attempts to trick Ladybug into thinking he is Cat Noir, but his trickery is figured out, and, upset that Ladybug won't take him over the real Cat Noir, he declares that if he can't have her, no one will. After he is returned to normal, Théo is happy by Ladybug's compliments on his statue and accepts her apology. Also recovering from his heartbreak, he admits he has come to peace about her and Cat Noir's relationship, not knowing that it was a lie.

=== [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] ===
Théo appreciates Cat Noir's work for Paris, but he becomes jealous and disgusted of him when Cat Noir lies that he and Ladybug are close. While being Copycat, he seeks revenge on Cat Noir by framing him for a crime and stealing his place as Ladybug's lover. Later, no longer Copycat, Théo gets over his crush on Ladybug and accepts Cat Noir's relationship with Ladybug.

== Trivia ==
* In the French dubbed version, Théo's supervillain name is called L'Imposteur.
* As Copycat, when he is imitating Cat Noir, he is voiced by [[Bryce Papenbrook]], the voice actor who actually portrays Adrien/Cat Noir.
* He makes various brief cameo appearances doing random jobs:
** In &quot;Dark Cupid&quot;, he is a furniture mover, helping to carry a large picture frame into [[Le Grand Paris]] for [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]].
** In &quot;The Mime&quot;, he helps advertise the pantomime show by holding a sign.
** In &quot;Animan&quot;, he is found in the bathroom of [[Collège Françoise Dupont]].
** In &quot;Pixelator&quot;, he becomes trapped in a photo with [[Mireille Caquet]], having been strolling down the [[Champs-Élysées]] with her.
** In &quot;Guitar Villain&quot;, he works as a DJ for [[XY]].
** In &quot;Kung Food&quot;, he is a boom operator for the [[World's Greatest Chef contest]].
** In &quot;Gigantitan&quot; and &quot;Sapotis&quot;, he is a rickshaw driver for Marinette's date and other people.
*** This also makes him the character with the most known jobs in the city.
* Théo is one of three characters to be akumatized into a [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]] version of a Miraculous superhero, with the others being [[Lila Rossi|Lila]] and [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloe]], but he is the only one to look exactly like the Miraculous superhero.
* Unlike Volpina but like Antibug, Copycat can only use his power once, while Volpina can use it as many times as she wishes

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6724">[[File:OR-2 (598).png|thumb|250x250px|Ladybug releasing a swarm of purified butterflies.]]
This is a list of '''minor animals'''. These are animals that have appeared in the [[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir|television series]] or other forms of media related to the series with minor appearances, background appearances, or one notable appearance.

== Bear ==
A bear is in an exhibit at the zoo in [[Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes]]. When [[Otis Césaire|Otis]] is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] in &quot;[[Animan]]&quot;, he releases the bear. While free, the bear uses a car as a back scratcher (a reference to the ''Jungle Book'') while its owner is trying to prop it up with a carjack.

== Butterflies ==
[[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] owns a bunch of white butterflies that he turns into [[Akuma|akumas]]. When the akumas are purified by [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and become regular butterflies again, they don't return to Hawk Moth's [[Hawk Moth's lair|lair]], roaming free throughout [[Paris]].

== Catfish ==
Multiple catfish live in the [[Seine]]. In the ''[[Miraculous Adventures]]'' story &quot;[[Miraculous Adventures Issue 2|Trash Krakken Part 1]]&quot;, after a [[Unnamed fisherman|fisherman]] is akumatized into the the [[Akumatized villains|villain]] Silurus, he gains the ability to control said catfish. One giant catfish lands with its mouth open onto [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]], who complains she is being swallowed by a &quot;too fresh piece of sushi.&quot;

== Cats ==
There are a couple instances where cats appear in the series.

=== Gray cats ===
[[File:SS (40).png|thumb|Marinette remembering saving a gray cat stuck in a tree.]]
While Marinette as Ladybug is trying to record a new video for [[Alya Césaire|Alya]] with Alya's [[Alya's cellphone|cellphone]] in &quot;[[The Mime]]&quot;, a gray cat comes by and knocks the placed cellphone into the garbage can below.

In &quot;[[Simon Says]]&quot;, Marinette thinks back to when as Ladybug she saved a gray cat in a tree. [[Mr. Damocles]], in his persona of The Owl, tries to save another gray cat stuck in a tree in &quot;[[The Dark Owl]]&quot;, but when the cat bites him, they both fall off the tree and Ladybug and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] catch them.
=== Black cat ===
A black cat only appears in the [[It's Ladybug|theme song]] when it runs in front of Marinette while she is running to [[Collège Françoise Dupont|school]], causing her to trip and fall.

== Crocodiles ==
[[Jagged Stone]] owns a crocodile named [[Fang]].

Another crocodile is in an exhibit at the zoo in Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes. When Otis is akumatized into Animan, he releases the crocodile.

== Eagle ==
An eagle is in an exhibit at the zoo in Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes. When Otis is akumatized into Animan, he releases the eagle.

== Elephant ==
[[File:AM-(324).png|left|thumb|Animan in front of the released zoo animals.]]An elephant is in an exhibit at the zoo in Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes. When Otis is akumatized into Animan, he releases the elephant.

== Flamingos ==
A flock of flamingos fly over the [[Île aux Cygnes]] in the ''Miraculous Adventures'' story &quot;The Trash Krakken Part 1&quot;.

== Giraffe ==
A giraffe is in an exhibit at the zoo in Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes. When Otis is akumatized into Animan, he releases the giraffe, who snatches and eats a potted tree plant from someone's balcony while free.

== Gorillas ==
Three gorillas are in an exhibit at the zoo in Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes. When Otis is akumatized into Animan, he releases the gorillas. During their time out of the cages, the gorillas mess around in the [[Métro]].

== Horses ==
[[File:Ladybug Christmas Special (555).png|thumb|The horses for Santa Claus' sleigh.]]
[[Santa Claus]] owns two brown horses that pull his sleigh through the snowy streets of Paris in &quot;[[A Christmas Special]]&quot;. When Santa is akumatized into Santa Claws, his horses are transformed into black reindeer.

== Ladybugs ==
A ladybug lands on the [[Valentine's Day card|Valentines' Day card]] that Marinette is writing for Adrien in &quot;[[Dark Cupid]]&quot;, Alya calling it a good omen. When Adrien receives the card later, he doesn't know who it's from because Marinette forgot to sign it. Another ladybug lands on it, and Adrien assumes it means that the card is from Ladybug.

== Panther ==
[[File:AM-(228).png|left|thumb|The panther growling.]]
A panther is a new addition to the zoo at the Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes. In &quot;Animan&quot;, [[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]] invites Marinette to go see the panther with him, and at the same time, [[Lê Chiến Kim|Kim]] and [[Max Kanté|Max]] come to view it. Kim mocks and belittles the panther, stressing out the panther and annoying the zookeeper, Otis. When Otis becomes Animan, he releases the panther.

In &quot;[[The Puppeteer]]&quot;, the endcard shows Marinette and [[Manon Chamack|Manon]] looking at the panther while visiting the zoo. By &quot;Syren&quot;, the zoo has another panther.

== Pigeons ==
Pigeons are a recurring species of bird in Paris. They have a lot of tiny notable appearances.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
* [[Xavier Ramier]] cherishes pigeons, and he enjoys feeding a huge flock of them, even where it is illegal. The pigeons fall under his control when he is akumatized into Mr. Pigeon in the [[Mr. Pigeon|episode of the same name]], following his orders, spying for him, grouping together in different shapes, attacking enemies, and kidnapping police officers. However, the pigeons stop listening to him if they see available food.
* One pigeon is watching Marinette, Alya, and [[Tikki]] on the balcony of Marinette's [[Marinette's room|room]] at the beginning of &quot;The Mime&quot;. When Alya is confused about who Marinette is talking to when she returns, Marinette claims she was talking to the pigeon, calling it Jacques.
* A pigeon blocks [[Juleka Couffaine]]'s face in a photo of her with [[Rose Lavillant]], as seen in &quot;[[Reflekta]]&quot;.
* A couple of pigeons perch on Antibug's sword after Cat Noir throws it and it gets stuck on the [[Eiffel Tower]] in &quot;[[Antibug]]&quot;.
* In &quot;[[Volpina]]&quot;, some of [[Lila Rossi|Volpina]]'s illusions are ruined by pigeons. One pigeon is hit by the comet illusion, and another hits a piece of rubble of the falling building illusion.
* In &quot;[[Reverser]]&quot; after Reverser hit Xavier Ramier with a paper airplane, Xavier's pigeons start fleeing from him.

{{Quote|And when it comes to luring superheroes, what could be better than creating supervillains?|[[Gabriel Agreste]]|&quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)|Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]&quot;}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''', also called '''evilized villains''', are people transformed into supervillains by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] with [[Akumatization]], the superpower of the [[Butterfly Miraculous]].

== Transformation ==
{{SpoilerButton}}[[File:TDO (426).png|thumb|left|Mr. Damocles being akumatized.]]
Whenever a person has strong negative emotions, such as anger, frustration, jealousy, disappointment, humiliation or sadness, Hawk Moth senses it from his lair and charges a butterfly with dark power to form an [[akuma]]. The akuma then flies away from Hawk Moth's lair to where the person is, and possesses [[List of akumatized objects|an important object that belongs to the person]]. 
Immediately, Hawk Moth telepathically links up to the person in order to communicate, using a butterfly-shaped light mask that goes around his and victim's eyes. Also, in that moment, the area around the person's eyes darkens into a dark rust color. He then gives them a new name for their supervillain identity and explains to the person that he'll give them the ability to accomplish their goals, if in turn, the person will retrieve the [[Ladybug Miraculous]] and [[Cat Miraculous]] from [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]].
[[File:Kim_corruption.gif|thumb|Kim being corrupted.]]
When the person agrees, black and purple smoke appears from the possessed object and surrounds the person. Once it recedes, the victim has transformed into a supervillain. If Hawk Moth needs to telepathically talk with them again, his light mask will reappear on both Hawk Moth and the villain.[[File:SW (738).png|thumb|left|Hawk Moth speaks to his akumatized victim.]]

As stated in &quot;[[Robostus]]&quot;, any sentient creature with emotions can be akumatized. For example, the robot [[Markov]] is akumatized in the aforementioned episode, and infant [[August]] is akumatized in &quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot;.
Sometimes, other living things or beings are indirectly transformed with the main victim, such as [[Fang]] changing into a dragon in &quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot; when [[Jagged Stone]] is akumatized, and [[Albert]] becoming a more advanced AI in &quot;[[The Dark Owl]]&quot; when [[Mr. Damocles]] is akumatized. Inanimate objects that are not the akumatized object can change because of the victim's akumatization, such as [[Roger Raincomprix]]'s car transforming in &quot;[[Rogercop]]&quot;.

While it is theoretically possible for someone with extreme willpower to resist or even overcome Hawk Moth's influence, only [[Caline Bustier|Miss Bustier]] has ever been shown doing so, and even she succumbed after approximately 30 seconds.

In &quot;[[Miraculer]]&quot;, [[Chloé Bourgeois]] is completely successful in refusing Hawk Moth's offer.

== Abilities ==
[[File:MP (501).png|thumb|Mr. Pigeon communicating with a pigeon.]]
An akumatized villain usually has an appearance and abilities that relate to their infected object, occupation, circumstances, and/or interests. For example, because of [[Xavier Ramier]]'s love of pigeons and his object being a pigeon call, he becomes Mr. Pigeon, a villain with a suit based off of pigeons and the ability to command pigeons. In whatever way they're changed, an akumatized villain usually has enhanced abilities and skills. A majority of the time, their objects end up becoming their weapons, such as [[Nino Lahiffe|The Bubbler's]] bubble wand and [[Jagged Stone|Guitar Villain]]'s [[Jagged Stone's guitar|guitar]].

Aside from their peculiar powers, supervillains seem to have enhanced strength, durability, and fighting skills. For example, [[Alya Césaire|Lady Wifi]] manages to pin down Cat Noir when they are both disarmed, and the [[Fred Haprèle|Mime]] is able to hold the [[Eiffel Tower]] with his own strength.
[[File:EV S01EP08 (509).png|thumb|Hawk Moth briefly controlling the Evillustrator's hand.|left]]
Every villain, after being corrupted, remembers the cause of their distress and the person who caused it, so they usually try to get revenge. Additionally, some villains, namely [[Théo Barbot|Copycat]], the [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg|Evillustrator]], and [[Mylène Haprèle|Horrificator]], remember the people whom they have romantic feelings for (Ladybug, Marinette, and [[Ivan Bruel]] respectively) and still care for them while transformed.

Hawk Moth can't mind control his villains, psychologically manipulating them instead.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/872000705967554560&lt;/ref&gt; He can't read their minds either, seeing and feeling only what they are seeing and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;https://curiouscat.me/MiraculousMX/post/256989254 and https://curiouscat.me/MiraculousMX/post/257013573&lt;/ref&gt; However, if a supervillain doesn't go and retrieve the Miraculous like they were asked to, Hawk Moth can control their bodies for a brief amount of time in order to inflict pain onto them until they agree to do it as quickly as possible. He can also remove their powers, another threat he uses against his victims to keep them on-task.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/872020337164251139&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OR1-(1091).png|thumb|Akumas multiplying.]]
As seen in &quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)|Ladybug &amp;amp; Cat Noir]]&quot; and &quot;[[Stoneheart (Origins - Part 2)|Stoneheart]]&quot;, if Ladybug doesn't purify a villain's akuma when she captures it, the akuma multiplies, and they transform various people into frozen copies of the villain. When the original akuma's victim is akumatized again, the copies unfreeze, and the villain has control over them, able to make them follow his or her orders and desires.

Because of Hawk Moth and the villain's mental connection, the villain can sense the location of Hawk Moth's lair if they want to find him, as seen in &quot;Robostus&quot; and &quot;[[The Dark Owl]]&quot;.

{{HideSpoiler|
In &quot;Timetagger&quot;, it is shown that akumatized villains can communicate directly to the Butterfly Miraculous holder, even if they are not the one who akumatized them initially, as seen with the titular villain who came from the future and was akumatized by another Hawk Moth that isn't Gabriel.}}

== Defeat ==
[[File:PH S01EP06 (697).png|thumb|Jalil being de-corrupted.|left]]
In order to defeat a villain and release the akuma, the akumatized object needs to be destroyed. After the object is destroyed, Ladybug uses her [[yo-yo]] to capture the akuma to &quot;de-evilize&quot; and revert it back into a unakumatized butterfly.

After the [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]] has reverted the damage caused since the akuma infected the villain, they are detransformed by the purple substance.

Those who are victimized will have their memories either be blurry of what happened (like a dream that can't be remembered)&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/694696400995667968&lt;/ref&gt;, or can remember what had happened entirely (Like Alya and Nino, who remembered their actions as Oblivio). However, those who volunteered will retain clear memories of their actions, examples being Gabriel Agreste (The Collector) and Lila Rossi (Volpina and Chameleon).

== Trivia ==
{{SpoilerButton}}
* Many of the supervillains' face masks, such as those of Stormy Weather, Lady Wifi, and the Evillustrator, resemble the shape of a butterfly, most likely in reference to the akumas. Similarly, the four eyeholes in Darkblade's helmet resemble the four wings of a butterfly.
[[File:SW (231).png|thumb]]
* When an akuma infects the object of the new villain and the light mask appears around their face, the darkened area is almost always an indication of the shape of their mask.
* There are some cases in which a villain reappears or gets akumatized in an irregular situation more than once.
** In &quot;[[Timebreaker]]&quot;, both Alixes from two different timelines get akumatized.
** Ivan transforms into Stoneheart in both of the [[The Origins Story|Origins]] episodes.
** In &quot;[[The Puppeteer]]&quot;, the Puppeteer uses her powers to bring back Lady Wifi, the Evillustrator, and Rogercop.
** According to Hawk Moth, it is implied that Lila may return as a villain due to her not forgiving Ladybug in &quot;[[Volpina]]&quot;.
*** This occurs in &quot;[[Catalyst]]&quot;, when Lila is encouraged because of her anger towards Ladybug, with the tipping point being Gabriel Agreste calling Volpina a copycat.
*** This happens a third time in &quot;[[Chameleon]]&quot;, when Lila actively takes the Akuma and infects herself to become the titular villain after Adrien declines her romantic affections until she stops her lies. At the end of the episode, she is still angry at Ladybug, implying further future Akumatizations.
* After Hawk Moth gives his victims their new names, they accept them, and discard their former names until they are defeated.
* Ladybug and Cat Noir usually try to persuade the supervillains to calm down and stop their rampage when they are able to do so.
* Most of the villains are seen near Marinette and/or Adrien shortly before the akuma infects them.
* In most cases, the villains usually get what they want when they are transformed or after they are defeated. However, this is not always the case.
** After the events of &quot;Volpina&quot;, Lila discards Ladybug's apology, thinking that Adrien will never be interested in her.
* It is unknown if non-humans, such as animals or [[kwamis]], can be akumatized, but [[Season 2]] will have some answers, as revealed by [[Thomas Astruc]] at San Diego Comic-Con 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/vtO8bbvmU0g?t=3012&lt;/ref&gt;
** In [[Robostus]], it is shown that emotionally-aware robots can be akumatized, when it happens to Markov, [[Max Kanté]]'s robot.
** In &quot;[[Queen Wasp (Queen's Battle - Part 2)|Queen Wasp]]&quot;, it's shown even Miraculous holders can be akumatized and their Miraculouses can be also be infected by an akuma.
[[File:GV (429).png|thumb|Fang as a dragon, transformed by Jagged Stone's akumatization.]]
* Various animals and objects that are not infected by the akuma can be transformed indirectly with the akumatized villains.
** Roger Raincomprix's police car transforms with him, its appearance changing and it becoming able to fly.
** When Jagged Stone turns into Guitar Villain, his crocodile Fang is transformed into a dragon.
** Santa Claus's horses turn into reindeer, and his sleigh changes its appearance as well, gaining the ability to fly.
** [[Albert]] is also akumatized alongside Mr. Damocles, as his monitor was the akumatized object; Albert gains a human face, as opposed to his normal cartoon appearance.
** Anarka Couffaine's boat transforms into an indestructible sentient ship that obeys Captain Hardrock's commands and can fire cannonball-shaped speakers and chain anyone.
** Marinette's Grandma (Gina Dupain)'s motorbike changed its appearance and gained the ability to fly when she was akumatized into &quot;[[Befana]]&quot;.
** [[Tomoe Tsurugi]]'s car is fused with her own body so she can become Ikari Gozen and trap her victims.
* According to [[Nooroo]], the Butterfly Miraculous is meant to create superheroes rather than supervillains.
** While Hawk Moth can force his victims to focus on getting Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses by threatening to remove their powers or causing them pain, the ability is supposed to be used to keep akumatized heroes from becoming evil.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/872021350373896196&lt;/ref&gt;
** Several times, however, akumatized villains would identify themselves as heroes, such as Dark Owl. Some villains call themselves heroes as a ruse, such as Volpina.
** A recurring element is people being akumatized into supervillain versions of heroes, such as Copycat, Antibug, Volpina, Queen Wasp, Rena Rage, and Shell Shock.
* [[Thomas Astruc]] noted that Marinette would be a hard person to akumatize as she is an optimistic person.&lt;ref&gt;Report on Thomas Astruc at Japan Weekend: https://twitter.com/Ladybug_Cartoon/status/780024002706305024&lt;/ref&gt;
** He also noted that Adrien has not yet been akumatized because he is so used to disappointment.&lt;ref&gt;Report on Thomas Astruc at Japan Weekend: https://twitter.com/Ladybug_Cartoon/status/780024002706305024&lt;/ref&gt;
* In &quot;[[Riposte]]&quot;, &quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot;, &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot; and &quot;[[Heroes' Day]]&quot;, the akuma is seen by Marinette and/or Adrien before the victim is akumatized.
* Marinette was super close to getting akumatized in &quot;[[Chameleon]]&quot; and &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot; but her emotions became positive and the akuma flew away.
* Many previous akumatized villains are re-akumatized during the &quot;Heroes' Day&quot; special in Season 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://miraculousdaily.tumblr.com/post/160777192491/spoilers Tumblr blog miraculousdaily covering the information revealed by the writers on May 17, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* As shown in &quot;[[Sapotis]]&quot; and &quot;[[Oblivio]]&quot;, two people can be akumatized from a single akuma and/or [[List of akumatized objects|object]].
* Most of the akumatized villains' powers are based on their hobbies or interests. For example, [[Nathaniel]]'s hobby is drawing whilst Evillustrator's power is making his drawings to life.
* During the Heroes’ Day special, the akumas instantly transform civilians without Hawk Moth directly talking to them like the normal purple akumas do.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' was a past [[Miraculous holders|Miraculous holder]] in ancient Egypt. It isn't certain if they had the [[Cat Miraculous]] or a different [[Miraculouses|Miraculous]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.comixology.com/Miraculous-Les-Aventures-de-Ladybug-et-Chat-Noir-Vol-1-Les-Origines-1-2/digital-comic/564645&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
The Miraculous holder's body was dark gray with feline features, including a tail, cat ears, and yellow sclerae. They wore yellow armlets, a belt, and anklets, and below their belt, they wore a white loincloth.

== Abilities ==
When transformed, the Miraculous holder had enhanced physical abilities, a [[Miraculous tools|tool]], and a special superpower.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/660373733396373504&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trivia ==
* The depiction of the holder appears in the first issue of the comic book series ''[[Miraculous: Les Aventures de Ladybug et Chat Noir (comic)|Miraculous: Les Aventures de Ladybug et Chat Noir]]'', which is a retelling of &quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)]]&quot;.
** The comic depicts the holder instead of [[Herakles]], who is pictured on Greek pottery in the original episode.
* By looking at this holder's clothing it's most likely that the person is male since men wore short wrap-round skirt.
** As of that he could be from the Old or Middle Kingdom of Egypt.

{{Quote|Majestia?! I don't believe it... Majestia! The most powerful, most brave, and most incredible superhero ever!|[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]]|[[Miraculous Adventures Issue 2|''Miraculous Adventures'' Issue 2]]}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a superhero in the United States of America.

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Tallish in height, Majestia has short blonde hair and blue eyes.

=== As Majestia ===
She wears a red sleeveless vest with a swan-necked collar, three gold stars and two jagged gold lines on the front, and a zipper-like line down the center of the front, along with a long coattail. Underneath the vest, she has a blue suit with exposed shoulders and long sleeves, and she wears red knee-high boots with two jagged gold lines around the upper edge.

== Personality ==
Majestia is brave, friendly, and reliable. She kindly explains information to [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]], such as the need to defeat the [[Kenya's father|Trash Krakken]]. While she can get impatient and annoyed on occasion, Majestia has a positive, understanding and determined outlook in general about a situation. This allows her to get along well with the superheroes she knows.

== Abilities ==
Majestia can fly even at extremely great heights.

== Family ==
{{Majestia Tree}}

== Relationships ==
=== [[Camilla Hombee|Camilla Hombee/Victory]] ===
Majestia follows Victory's commands loyally, trusting in her judgement to cause a lot of damage in order to stop the Trash Krakken despite temporarily stopping it after getting a less risky plan. When Victory reveals herself in her superhero costume, Majestia congenially notes that Victory doesn't need to wear the mask as everyone knows her secret identity.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] ===
Majestia supports and assists Ladybug and Cat Noir, informing them about the Trash Krakken situation and other superheroes. Their sudden departure to de-transform confuses her and she becomes irked when they come back later than promised, but she doesn't hold it against them for long. Particularly, Majestia strongly believes that Ladybug is important to the success of stopping the Trash Krakken, noting that they're all counting on her. She trusts her and Cat Noir with their own plan, to the point of stalling and halting [[Knightowl]]'s plan at Cat Noir's request. Also, Majestia considers Ladybug and Cat Noir's feelings toward each other as &quot;young love&quot;, much to the annoyance of Ladybug.

{{Quote|Cat Noir! Follow us. Time is running out.|Knightowl|[[Miraculous Adventures Issue 2|''Miraculous Adventures'' Issue 2]]}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a superhero in the United States with her partner [[Sparrow]].

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Outside of her superhero disguise, Knightowl is a tall woman with a large build. She has light brown eyes, long flowing brown hair, and small red lips.

=== As Knightowl ===
Knightowl wears a dark brown cowl with golden spikes akin to an owl's eyebrows over her eyes and a long cape. Underneath, she wears a bodysuit that covers her entire body, including her mouth and chin that aren't covered by the cowl. The suit's shoulders, upper chest, and legs are a darker shade of brown, and on the upper chest, there is a logo of an owl's face comprised of gold lines. Also, she wears brown gloves with gold talon-like claws on the fingers, and she wears a golden belt around her hips. With her mask on, she has dark green irises in her eyes.
{{For2|more of Knightowl's outfits and designs|Knightowl/Designs}}

== Personality ==
Knightowl is serious, irritable, and straightforward. Saving others in danger is important to her, which makes her frustrated and stern towards anyone who doesn't take the task as seriously, jokes around, or disobeys orders. Preferring solid, perfect plans without a chance of failing, Knightowl doesn't like questionable or risky suggestions, having little faith in them if they're not based on strong evidence or reasoning. Sometimes, she is willing to put her stubbornness aside to try alternate options and work together with people she doesn't agree with.

Liking to take the lead and being good at commanding a team, while she can get impatient with others, Knightowl takes them seriously and gives them clear, strong orders to follow. Tending toward a negative disposition, she judges others harshly, and bluntly gives her opinions of them without consideration. However, Knightowl is experienced, thus knowing the dangers of her job, and calming new fellow superheroes in difficult situations. She also has a softer side, laughing with [[Majestia]] and Sparrow about [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]]'s budding romance.

== Abilities ==
Knightowl is physically fit, having enough stamina and skill to keep up with Ladybug and Cat Noir while they're running, and to jump from edge to edge down a huge crack in the ground. She throws boomerangs based off of her logo with great strength and precision. Additionally, Knightowl is a skilled strategist, devising the initial destructive plan to destroy the Trash Krakken and giving commands to Ladybug, Cat Noir, and Sparrow when they're about to battle him.

== Relationships ==

=== [[Sparrow]] ===
Knightowl treats Sparrow as a sidekick, seeing him in a similar but less judgemental fashion to Cat Noir. She trusts him enough to listen to him and his advice, such as begrudgingly agreeing to stray from her original plan for ten minutes when he persuades her to try Ladybug and Cat Noir's plan. Though close to him, Knightowl continues the mission after his apparent demise, thinking of it as a way of honoring his sacrifice.

=== Unnamed partner ===
Knightowl trusts her butler/partner to such a degree that [[Mr. Damocles|a fan]] of hers decided to create an artificial version of said partner, and was attached to it enough for it to become his [[List of akumatized objects|akumatized object]].

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] ===
Knightowl is aloof and critical of Ladybug and Cat Noir, displeased with them when they run off briefly so they can detransform, and when they jump down a hole to confront the [[Kenya's father|Trash Krakken]] instead of following Victory's direction. In particular, she finds Cat Noir annoying, thinking of him as a sidekick who mainly goofs off. However, she knows how important Ladybug is in the mission and relies on Cat Noir to calm her down after the apparent demise of Sparrow.

Despite her criticism of them, after they explain how they want to try taking [[Mr. Squid]] from Trash Krakken, Knightowl relents and works with them to execute the plan, though not without disagreements along the way.

* In the fourth issue of ''Miraculous Adventures'', it is revealed that Knightowl keeps her identity and true gender a secret from the other heroes.
* As seen in &quot;The Dark Owl&quot;, [[Mr. Damocles]] is a fan of Knightowl, having a suit similar to hers and a small collection of her comics hidden inside his office.

'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; is a [[Kwamis|kwami]] who is connected to the [[Dog Miraculous]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://pandasuite.com/viewer/2.0.2/59a6c26e48abe6f53a002dc9?t=1 (direct video source [https://data.pandasuite.com/videos/59a3e7def643f27d7300131b-universal_1024_1024_20_main_3-0.mp4 here])&lt;/ref&gt; With his power, its [[Miraculous holders|wearer]] can use the Miraculous to transform into a dog-themed superhero. He is currently dormant in his Miraculous in [[Wang Fu|Master Wang Fu]]'s [[Miracle Box]], as seen in &quot;[[Sapotis]]&quot;.

== Appearance ==
Barkk is light brown with a white mark around his mouth, between his eyes, and on his chest. He has gray eyes, drop ears, a whisker on his forehead, and a pink tongue. He also has a tail that curves upwards.

== Abilities ==
Barkk can fly, levitate, and phase through solid objects. He can also carry objects that are larger and/or heavier than himself.

As a kwami, Barkk is able to transform the holder of the Dog Miraculous into a dog-themed superhero, although it is currently unknown what the transformation looks like or what powers the transformed person gains.

== History ==
=== Before Season 2 ===
Barkk came into existence when the concept connected to it came into existence. Before the Miraculous jewels were created, he and the other kwamis traveled all over the universe unable to interact with humans. Then, thousands of years later, a [[Unnamed mage|mage]] created the [[Miraculouses]]. When its Miraculous was not being worn, Barkk was dormant in the Dog Miraculous, which was stored inside the Miracle Box.

=== Season 2 ===
During Season 2, Barkk was dormant in the Dog Miraculous.

In &quot;Sandboy&quot;, Barkk was celebrating [[Nooroo]]'s birthday in the Miracle Box with the other kwamis, and he was excited when [[Tikki]] and [[Plagg]] arrived. He marveled at the gift Tikki brought, a marker that he thought was a paintbrush, and he played with the other kwamis. When it came the time to find Nooroo, Barrk got into position in an effort to contact him, but they contacted his [[Gabriel Agreste|wielder]] instead. Hearing him, the kwamis shuddered at the thought of being his slave, and they prevented him from discovering their location by cutting off the connection. They realized if they contacted Nooroo's wielder, rather than Nooroo, then someone must have been akumatized, and Tikki and Plagg's wielders would be in danger.

=== Season 3 ===
During Season 3, Barkk was dormant in the Dog Miraculous.

== Sightings ==
=== Episodes ===
{{AppearancesS2|SB=yes}}

== Trivia ==
* Barkk was first revealed from a [[Season 2|second season]] trailer on August 31, 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
** Barkk's name was confirmed in the credits of the Latin American Spanish dub of &quot;Sandboy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/Kyoi_Tekina/status/1061763079581634562 and https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/1061767042565455872&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dogs are symbols of loyalty, assistance, protection, communication, and other things.
* The dog is the eleventh animal of the [[Wikipedia:Chinese zodiac|Chinese zodiac]].
* Barkk has a noticeable feminine voice and uses female pronouns in the English dub, whereas the kwami has a distinctly masculine voice and uses male pronouns in the French dub.

When it came the time to find Nooroo, Stompp got into position but in an effort to contact him, they contacted his wielder instead. Seeing this as their chance to find Nooroo, she encouraged the others to keep to singing. Hearing his voice, she shuddered at the thought of being his slave and prevented them from being discovered when they all cut off the connection.

He is currently dormant in his Miraculous in [[Wang Fu|Master Wang Fu]]'s [[Miracle Box]], as seen in &quot;[[Sapotis]]&quot;.

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;[[Ikari Gozen]]&quot;, he becomes active to help [[Kagami Tsurugi]] transform into Ryuko.}}

== Appearance ==
Longg is red with four black horns on his forehead: a black horn on each side of his face, and red horns from the upper back of his head with black spirals. Additionally, he has golden eyes, a whisker on each cheek next to his mouth, two small black spikes on his lower back, and a long tail with three black tips at the end.

{{HideSpoiler|
== Personality ==
Longg is a bit formal calling Kagami &quot;young lady&quot; having a gentleman's approach and is quite informative explaining his powers. He has a tendency to ramble on a bit not seeing that his wielder is trapped inside an akumatized villain, but knows not to rush as he tried to tell Kagami Ladybug's plans.}}

== Abilities ==
Longg can fly, levitate, and phase through solid objects. He can also carry objects that are larger and/or heavier than him.

As a kwami, Longg is able to transform the holder of the Dragon Miraculous into a dragon-themed superhero.

{{HideSpoiler|He gives the user the power to use abilities of water, air and lightning transforming into one of the three elements they chose just by saying water, air or lightning dragon. After all three elements have been used Longg loses energy giving the wearer five minutes until they transform back. It seems that Longg can fuse his powers with Tikki's to create the hybrid wielder [[Dragon Bug]].

== Relationships ==
=== [[Kagami Tsurugi]] ===
As Longg and Kagami meet the Dragon Kwami tells her the abilities he'll grant her as Ryuko, but as she activates the Miraculous, Longg tries to stop her before he could fully inform Kagami of Ladybug's plan.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] ===
Longg knowing Ladybug's plan to defeat Ikari Gozen, as he had tried to tell it to Kagami before she activates transformation of the Kwami's miraculous, indicates that Ladybug might have gone over it with Longg before sending the Dragon Miraculous Kagami's way. As well as how she knows the Kwami's name, when she asked Ryuko if Longg had indeed gone over their plan with her.}}

== History ==
=== Before Season 2 ===
When the concept of weather came into existence, Longg came into existence. Before the Miraculous jewels were created, Longg and the other kwamis traveled all over the universe unable to interact with humans. Then, thousands of years ago, a [[Unnamed mage|mage]] created the [[Miraculouses]]. When his Miraculous was not being worn, Longg was dormant in the Dragon Miraculous, which was stored inside the Miracle Box.

=== Season 2 ===
During Season 2, Longg was dormant in the Dragon Miraculous.

In &quot;Sandboy&quot;, Longg was celebrating [[Nooroo]]'s birthday in the Miracle Box with the other kwamis, and they were excited when [[Tikki]] and [[Plagg]] arrived. The kwamis marveled at the gift Tikki brought, a marker, and played with each other. When the time to find Nooroo came, Longg got into position in an effort to contact him, but the kwamis contacted his [[Gabriel Agreste|wielder]] instead. Hearing his voice, the kwamis shuddered at the thought of being his slave and prevented them from being discovered when they all cut off the connection. They realized if they contacted Nooroo's wielder, rather than Nooroo, then someone must have been [[Akumatization|akumatized]], and Tikki and Plagg's wielders would be in danger.

=== Season 3 ===
During Season 3, Longg was dormant in the Dragon Miraculous.

{{HideSpoiler|
In &quot;Ikari Gozen&quot;, Longg and his Miraculous were loaned to Kagami as a &quot;special delivery&quot; by Ladybug. Upon meeting her he tried to explain his powers and Ladybug's plan to his wielder but became surprised when Kagami said the words, instantly transforming her into Ryuko, without informing her fully. After the trio saved his wielder's mother, Longg and his Miraculous were returned to Ladybug and then to Master Fu.}}

He is currently dormant in his Miraculous in [[Wang Fu|Master Wang Fu]]'s [[Miracle Box]], as seen in &quot;[[Sapotis]]&quot;.

In &quot;[[Party Crasher]]&quot;, he becomes active to help [[Lê Chiến Kim]] transform into King Monkey.

== Appearance ==
Xuppu is 10 centimeters (or 4 inches) tall and is light brown with a yellow mark on his face. He has yellow ears, brown eyes with the irises being black, and a long tail.

==Personality==
Not much is known about Xuppu except he's mischievous and playful. He is also easily offended as shown when Kim called him a plushie.

== Abilities ==
Xuppu can fly, levitate, and phase through solid objects. He can also carry objects that are larger and/or heavier than himself.

As a kwami, Xuppu is able to transform the holder of the Monkey Miraculous into a monkey-themed superhero.

He gives his wielder the ability to use the superpower [[Uproar]], which allows the holder to summon an item with their weapon to later throw it at the opponent. Once struck, it will cause the target's powers and abilities go temporarily out of control.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Lê Chiến Kim]] ===
At first, Xuppu looks like he and Kim don't get along (since Xuppu calls Kim a nitwit and Kim calls Xuppu a plushie) as the two make exchange of funny faces but is impressed that Kim is a quick learner.

== History ==
=== Before Season 2 ===
When the concept of jubilation came into existence, Xuppu came into existence. Before the Miraculous jewels were created, Xuppu and the other kwamis traveled all over the universe unable to interact with humans. Then, thousands of years ago, a [[Unnamed mage|mage]] created the Miraculouses. Xuppu started out in [[Sun Wukong|China]] and was later in [[Sasuke Sarutobi|Japan]]. When his Miraculous was not being worn, Xuppu was dormant in the Monkey Miraculous, which was stored inside the Miracle Box.

=== Season 2 ===
In [[Season 2]], Xuppu was dormant in the Monkey Miraculous.

In &quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;, Xuppu was celebrating [[Nooroo]]'s birthday in the Miraculous box with the other kwamis, and was excited when [[Tikki]] and [[Plagg]] arrived. They marveled at the gift Tikki brought as they thought it was a paintbrush, and they drew a line with the marker to the other kwamis. Starting to play the music, Xuppu danced with the others kwamis. When it came the time to find Nooroo, they got into position in an effort to contact him, but instead, they contacted his [[Gabriel Agreste|wielder]] instead. Hearing his voice, he shuddered at the thought of being his slave and prevented them from being discovered when they all cut off the connection. They realized if they contacted Nooroo's wielder, rather than Nooroo, then someone must have been akumatized, realizing the danger Tikki and Plagg's wielders were in.

=== Season 3 ===
During Season 3, Xuppu was dormant in the Monkey Miraculous.

In &quot;[[Party Crasher]]&quot;, Xuppu and his Miraculous are given to Lê Chiến Kim by Master Fu after Ladybug, Cat Noir, Carapace, Viperion and Pegasus have failed against Party Crasher. Upon meeting him, Xuppu was offended when Kim called him a plush toy, sticking his tongue after he introduced himself. The two then engaged in a match of making funny faces. Afterwards, the two transformed into King Monkey and use their power [[Uproar]] to make Party Crasher's powers go haywire, allowing them to free the other heroes and defeat the party villain. Xuppu was returned to the Monkey Miraculous which was given back to Master Fu.

{{Quote| Yeah! Oh, what a jewel, what a jewel!|Daizzi|&quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; is a [[Kwamis|kwami]] who is connected to the [[Pig Miraculous]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://pandasuite.com/viewer/2.0.2/59a6c26e48abe6f53a002dc9?t=1 (direct video source [https://data.pandasuite.com/videos/59a3e7def643f27d7300131b-universal_1024_1024_20_main_3-0.mp4 here])&lt;/ref&gt; With his power, its [[Miraculous holders|wearer]] can use the Miraculous to transform into a pig-themed superhero. He is currently dormant in his Miraculous in [[Wang Fu|Master Wang Fu]]'s [[Miracle Box]], as seen in &quot;[[Sapotis]]&quot;.

== Appearance ==
Daizzi is 10 centimeters (or 4 inches) tall and is light pink with a large black mark around his left eye. He has pink eyes, a pink antenna on the top of his head, floppy pig-like ears, a pig snout, and a thin, curly tail.

== Personality ==
Not much is known about Daizzi, except that he is excitable and curious.

== Abilities ==
Daizzi can fly, levitate, and phase through solid objects. He can also carry objects that are larger and/or heavier than himself.

As a kwami, Daizzi is able to transform the holder of the Pig Miraculous into a pig-themed superhero, although it is unknown what the transformation looks like or what powers the transformed person gains.

== History ==
=== Before Season 2 ===
Before the Miraculous jewels were created, Daizzi and the other kwamis travelled all over the universe, unable to interact with humans. Then, thousands of years ago, a [[Unnamed mage|mage]] created the Miraculouses. When his Miraculous was not being worn, Daizzi was dormant in the Pig Miraculous, which was stored inside Master Fu's Miracle Box.

=== Season 2 ===
During Season 2, Daizzi was dormant in the Pig Miraculous.

In &quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;, Daizzi was celebrating [[Nooroo]]'s birthday in the Miracle Box with the other kwamis, and was excited when [[Tikki]] and [[Plagg]] arrived. Interrupting [[Pollen]] to ask what the two brought as presents for the occasion, he marveled at Tikki's gift, a yellow marker. The kwamis thought it was a paintbrush and played with it until [[Xuppu]] started the party. When the time came to contact Nooroo, Daizzi got into his required position; but in the effort to contact him, the kwamis contacted [[Gabriel Agreste|his wielder]] instead. Hearing the villain's voice, the kwami shuddered at the thought of being his slave. To prevent the discovery of their whereabouts, the kwamis broke off the connection, and realized that if they contacted Nooroo's wielder rather than Nooroo himself, then someone must have been [[Akumatization|akumatized]], and that Tikki and Plagg's [[French Miraculous superhero team|wielders]] were in danger.

=== Season 3 ===
During Season 3, Daizzi was dormant in the Pig Miraculous.

== Trivia ==
* Daizzi was first revealed in a [[Season 2|second season]] trailer on August 31, 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
** Daizzi's name was confirmed in the credits of the Latin American Spanish dub of &quot;Sandboy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/1061767042565455872&lt;/ref&gt;
* A few qualities that pigs represent are virility, sincerity, sloth, and determination.
* The pig is the twelfth animal of the [[Wikipedia:Chinese zodiac|Chinese zodiac]], being also sometimes represented as a boar.
* Daizzi's name is a reference to the pig character Zhu Bajie from ''[[wikipedia:Journey to the West|Journey to the West]]'', who is often called &quot;Dai Zi&quot;, which means &quot;idiot&quot;. While his name in the English version of the story is Pigsy or simply Pig.
** One of [[Xuppu]]'s past holders [[Sun Wukong]], also known as the Monkey King, journeys beside Zhu Bajie in ''Journey to the West''. But Zhu Bajie being a past holder of the Pig Miraculous is unknown.

{{Quote|And I was [the best], everywhere I went.|Kagami|&quot;[[Riposte]]&quot;|quotelink = yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a Japanese student at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]] who appears in [[Season 2]] of ''[[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]'' who attracts the attention of [[Adrien Agreste]] as a rival in fencing.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://pandasuite.com/viewer/2.0.2/59a6c26e48abe6f53a002dc9?t=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tvmag.lefigaro.fr/programme-tv/miraculous-les-secrets-de-la-saison-2-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir_d32cc720-a2c3-11e7-b619-f944cd28c6f6/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://adala-news.fr/2017/09/le-plein-dinformations-sur-lanime-miraculous-ladybug-saison-2/ (translated by Tumblr fan [http://official-ladyblog.tumblr.com/post/165848228570/season-2-synopsis-leak official-ladybug])&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[Riposte]]&quot;, after Kagami mistakenly thinks that she lost the fencing battle with Adrien, she is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Riposte''', a fencing themed [[Akumatized villains|villain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://pandasuite.com/viewer/2.0.2/59a6c26e48abe6f53a002dc9?t=1 (direct video source [https://data.pandasuite.com/videos/59a3e7def643f27d7300131b-universal_1024_1024_20_main_3-0.mp4 here])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tf1pro.com/sites/default/files/atoms/files/miraculous_dossier_de_presse_saison2_low_def_tf1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in &quot;[[Oni-Chan]]&quot;, after seeing a picture of [[Lila Rossi]] kissing Adrien, Kagami is akumatized into '''Oni-Chan''', a demon rose-themed villain.

{{HideSpoiler|
In &quot;[[Ikari Gozen]]&quot;, after Kagami is made imprisoned by the [[Tomoe Tsurugi|titular villain]], Ladybug gives her the [[Dragon Miraculous]] in order to both free her and defeat Ikari Gozen. When the Miraculous is inhabited by [[Longg]], she becomes '''Ryuko''', a dragon-themed superhero who helps Ladybug and Cat Noir &quot;during particularly difficult missions&quot; in the episodes of [[Season 3]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BySrsfaAeqP/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Kagami is a slender pale-skinned Japanese teenager of average height with short dark blue hair swept to the left that has light blue reflections, sharp yellow-brown eyes and visible freckles.

=== Civilian attire ===
Kagami wears a white long-sleeved blazer that has black outlines around the collar, running down across her waist all the way to the bottom to the hem, cuffs and two black accents on the top of the fastened outer pockets. The blazer also has two gold pockets around the waist and each side of the cuffs. On the top right of her chest is an attached logo that is shaped as a reuleaux triangle. The logo includes her family's crest, with the gold sign of Japanese kanji for '''female''' (女) fastened on top of green, white and red fabric with a gold outline surrounding the logo. Underneath, Kagami wears a black collared blouse with many gold buttons. Attached to the collar is a red tie with blue parallel lines which intersects with each other. 

Moreover, Kagami wears a red skirt with an asymmetrical texture that has blue and white intersecting vertical and horizontal lines. She wears tight black leggings and a pair of red sneakers with white toecaps, laces, a black logo on the heel counter and black soles. 

On the ring finger of her right hand, she wears a black ring that has her family's crest (女) and it has two long outward spikes stretching from the mark. 

=== As Riposte ===
Riposte's face and skin is silver with red eyes. She has a silver helmet with angular sides and a red circle on the center of the forehead with the Tsurugi crest. Her body outfit is silver armor; a breastplate, pauldrons and tassets while her arms and legs are solid silver and she wears silver high-heel shoes. Her right hand seems to be or holds a sword-like extension with a triangular guard and a red circle bearing the Tsurugi crest on the center of the guard.

=== As Oni-Chan ===
As Oni-Chan she has a white outfit with an image of a rose that has a thorn sticking out from the top of the flower, red spikes on the shoulders, a red unicorn's horn, and spider like mandibles.

{{HideSpoiler|
=== As Ryuko ===
As Ryuko, she wears a red bodysuit with an image of a black rose with a yellow outlining envolving her from her left leg to her chest with the flower holding the images that represent the three elements she controls: lightning, air and water. She also has a black collar/turtleneck (where she has her choker), black forearm-length gloves and black legs starting at a point in the middle of her lower legs, both with yellow outlining. On the back of her head, she has four red dragon like horns with yellow tips with black outlining and, on her back, she has a holder for her sword. On her face, she wears a red mask around her eyes with yellow and black outline at the base of the sides. Her eyes also get golden with a yellow sclerae.}}

{{For2|more of Kagami's outfits and designs|Kagami Tsurugi/Designs}}



== Personality ==
[[File:RP_(839).png|thumb|left|Kagami apologizes to Adrien.]] 
Kagami is a stern, thoughtful, and adaptive Japanese girl who is dedicated to accomplishing any commitment she makes. Likewise, she can be somewhat reluctant and quite stubborn, willing to go out and take risks regardless of what is at stake for her as she is an aggressive fencer that she will taunt her opponent during the fight. While she doesn't like to lose due to her competitive nature, she downplays her upset feelings and respects her rivals. However, Kagami is a very hospitable and determined individual who learns from her mistakes, knowing there are times she isn't the winner. She also forms a friendship with [[Adrien Agreste]] after they both approach each other and solve their conflict professionally, suggesting an understanding, calm, and objective side.

[[File:Frozer_(101).png|thumb|Kagami asks Adrien what's wrong.]]
In &quot;[[Frozer]]&quot;, Kagami comes across as blunt and willing to speak her mind, telling [[Philippe]] that she did not want to take skating lessons multiple times, and even speaking for Adrien when asked. Her bluntness is also evident when she advises [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] to stop hesitating.

Kagami also a bit of a habit of jumping to conclusions seen in &quot;Oni-Chan&quot;, when she saw a picture of Adrien and [[Lila Rossi]] together quickly assuming she was the girl he told her about in &quot;Frozer&quot;. In the same episode, it is revealed that Kagami can be quite emotive and rage-prone in spite of her composed exterior.

{{HideSpoiler|
In &quot;Ikari Gozen&quot;, Kagami, like Lila, is a bit lonely as she always wanted friends but unlike Lila, she isn't willing to lie to get them as she admitted to Ladybug that she doesn't have any friends. And yet, she was willing to reach out to Marinette in an attempt to be friends with her. However, much like when Adrien started studying at school and making new friends, Kagami, because of [[Tomoe Tsurugi]] (her mother), doesn't know much about how to bond with others. As it is shown when she tried to befriend Marinette, only resulting in awkward moments, and using an app about how to make friends.

As Ryuko, she is a quick learner, but a bit of a loner as she tried to defeat Ikari Gozen on her own but learned she can't handle everything on her own. However, she is also a little revealing as she told her mother in her akumatized form (and by extension to Hawk Moth) her identity. Despite that, she is also understanding and respectful towards Ladybug, giving up the Dragon Miraculous indefinitely because of the fact that her identity was revealed to Hawk Moth to what will lead to her loves ones to be in danger showing her caring side.}}

As Riposte, she is furiously obsessed with getting a rematch with Adrien and winning it, even if he is in no condition to fight due to his injured ankle, and she considers people that she views as not being good enough fighters as not being worthy, such as Ladybug. Riposte is also arrogant and doesn't have a problem with outright attacking her opponents when they have no chance of defending themselves. However, despite this, she follows Hawk Moth's commands without question, even if they conflict with her own goals.

As Oni-Chan, she is obsessed with tracking down Lila and getting her to renounce Adrien in order to have Adrien be hers.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Kagami is extremely skilled in fencing, both in defensive and offensive movements. She is also very agile, doing several acrobatic feats while dueling. In &quot;[[Frozer]]&quot;, she considers archery a &quot;noble art&quot; alongside fencing, so it is possible she also excels at it, though it has yet to be shown. Kagami is also notably skilled in ice skating, proficient enough to do a combination spin, even though she only does it &quot;just for fun&quot;.

=== As Riposte ===
Riposte wields a sword in combat and as her sword is directly attached to her hand, so it is impossible to remove it. She uses the sword to strike at incredible speeds and slice through any material. She can create shock waves with her sword to slice objects from a distance. Also, she is capable of leaping great distances, and she is durable, quickly recovering from having an entire chimney collapse on her.

=== As Oni-Chan ===
Besides possessing heightened abilities, like speed, strength and agility, Oni-Chan possesses a sword that can wield powerful red energy. When she touches someone with that sword, they grow a horn like hers. The horn seemingly works as a cell tower, and sends messages to anyone with a mobile phone that is near the person with the horn, allowing her to trade places with the ones who get her messages and continually track said person as a result. However, it would appear that Oni-Chan doesn't have full control over this power, as she wasn't able to prevent her from trading places with a firefighter when she was about to take Ladybug's Miraculous or trading places with Ladybug who was tied up to a light post. Another effect of the horn is that, when the person afflicted with it lies, the horn grows bigger.

{{HideSpoiler|
=== As Ryuko ===
Ryuko has super enhanced skills, such as speed, agility, and strength, and she is almost invulnerable to physical damage. Her natural ability in wielding a sword is also enhanced.

Her special superpower of the elements allows her to transform into one of three elements imbued in the Dragon Miraculous: water, air, and lightning. So long as the superpower is not used the wielder can sustain the transformation indefinitely, however, once all three elemental transformations are used she only has about five minutes before she transforms back.}}

=== [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien Agreste/Cat Noir]] ===
[[File:RP (220).png|thumb|left|Kagami and Adrien fence together.]] 
Kagami first meets Adrien when she tryouts for a spot in fencing school. She fences with him and is distraught when she mistakenly believes that she lost, though she keeps her feelings to herself and even shakes his hand. Though Adrien offers her a decisive match, she sadly rejects the offer. However, once akumatized as Riposte, she targets Adrien, wanting a rematch with him at all costs. When she is deakumatized, she befriends him and agrees to eventually have a decisive match.

[[File:Frozer_(117).png|thumb|Kagami advises Adrien to “change targets”]]
In &quot;Frozer&quot;, she shows great concern for him when she notices how down he is. When Adrien tells her about his love issues, Kagami advises him to change his target. She accompanies him to the ice rink and after Frozer's defeat, when Adrien tells her that he has decided not to change targets, Kagami respects his wishes but tells him that she'll be waiting for him when he gives up.

In “[[Animaestro]]”, Kagami is happy to see Adrien at the movie premiere, but she becomes jealous upon noticing Marinette and Chloé, aware that they both also like Adrien. According to Mrs. Tsurugi, Kagami talks a lot about him. In &quot;Oni-Chan&quot;, it is shown that Kagami really has strong feelings for Adrien as she flies into a bitter rage after seeing a photo of Lila kissing Adrien, leading to her akumatization.

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;Ikari Gozen&quot; she was willing to disobey her mother to participate in a contest Adrien was taking part in.}}

She is unaware of Adrien's double life as Cat Noir. During &quot;Riposte&quot;, she is very angry that along with Ladybug that he's protecting Adrien and an inferior opponent. In &quot;Oni-Chan&quot;, she calls the hero inferior to his civilian alter ego and is furious when he compares himself to Adrien. After she is deakumatized, Kagami gladly accepts back the rose he gives her.

As Ryuko, Kagami doesn't at first work along with Cat Noir but when it results in him being held captive. She apologizes to Ladybug for failing them both believing that she's not worthy to work along side him. After being encouraged by Ladybug, she willingly lets herself get captured to save Cat Noir and takes the cat's compliment about being a fast learner. Like Ladybug, he included her in their trademark pound it.}}



=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
Kagami doesn't know Marinette too well, but when Adrien tells her about her, she says that she hopes to get to know her better. In &quot;Frozer&quot;, she advises Marinette to stop hesitating in order to stop slipping on the ice rink. In &quot;Animaestro&quot;, she treats Marinette hostility due to her crush on Adrien.

{{HideSpoiler|During a friendship contest in &quot;Ikari Gozen&quot;, she attempts to make friends with Marinette upon seeing her; Kagami finds her weird seeing Marinette talking to herself but continues to try.

But when she heard that Marinette had her phone with her mother on the line she urged her not to said anything but Marinette apologized for letting things slip out and tried to hide her. After saving her mother but not winning the contest the game made their friendship stronger, Kagami with understanding what Adrien said about her. She is glad to have Marinette as a friend and the two go out together.}}

Like Adrien, she is also unaware of Marinette's double life as Ladybug. As Riposte, she finds her inferior as an opponent. After being deakumatized, she is in awe at the sight of the heroine. As Oni-Chan, she is furious when she tries to stop her from hurting Lila.

{{HideSpoiler|
As Ryuko, Kagami doesn't at first work along with Ladybug, but when it results in Cat Noir being held captive, she is able to see the wrong of her actions and apologizes to Ladybug for failing them both, believing that she's not worthy to work along side them. But she is comforted by the heroine and encouraged to try again. Following Ladybug's lead, they are able to save Cat Noir and her mother. Like Cat Noir, she included her in their trademark pound it. However, when she heard that Ladybug can never let her have the Dragon Miraculous again, Kagami believed at first she had failed, but the heroine says the opposite. Because Hawk Moth knows her identity, it will leave her friends and family in danger if she keeps being Ryuko. Kagami retorts about not having many friends. However, she then took Ladybug's advice believing it's not about having many friends; it's about treasuring the true friendships you do have.}}

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
In &quot;Animaestro&quot;, it is revealed that Chloé and Kagami hate each other due to the former's crush on Adrien.

=== [[Lila Rossi]]===
Kagami hasn't met Lila in person as herself. But when she sees a picture of her kissing Adrien in &quot;Oni-Chan&quot;, she flies into a jealous rage towards her, quickly assuming she's the girl Adrien loves. As Oni-Chan, she tries to get Lila to renounce him, and constantly pursues and threatens her in order to make her do so.

At first, she is surprised at his presence unsure of what he is but she does listen to the information he gives but not all of it.}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/755033027823046656&lt;/ref&gt; is an Italian student in [[Miss Bustier's class]] at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]] and the tertiary antagonist of ''[[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]''. Her lying behaviour tends to cause great trouble for [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://roboticrainboots.tumblr.com/post/159689854591/im-not-sure-if-it-was-ever-confirmed-that-lila&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[Volpina]]&quot;, after Ladybug humiliates her in front of Adrien Agreste by exposing her lies about the both of them being close friends and her owning the [[Fox Miraculous]], she is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste/Gallery|Hawk Moth]] into '''Volpina''', a fox-themed [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]] who is a master of illusions.

In &quot;[[Heroes' Day]]&quot;, after Gabriel Agreste calls Volpina a false hero in comparison to Ladybug on TV, she is once again akumatized as '''Volpina'''. Afterwards she takes part in Hawk Moth's plan to acquire the [[Ladybug Miraculous|Ladybug]] and [[Cat Miraculous|Cat]] [[Miraculouses]].

Later in &quot;[[Chameleon]]&quot;, in order to get revenge on Ladybug again, she willingly becomes akumatized into '''Chameleon''', a shape-shifting supervillain.

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Lila stands at average height with olive green eyes and long, hip-length chestnut brown hair with bangs similar to a horse mane. Her hair is loosely tied at the tips with orange bands where she has two shorter strands of hair.

=== Civilian attire ===
She has red-orange wristbands on her right arm. She wears a red-orange jacket over a dark gray romper that has tiny white spots. Additionally, she wears light gray tights and brown high heel boots.

=== As Volpina ===
Volpina wears an orange mask with black edges, and her hair bands are black. On top of her head, two fake orange ears with white and black insides are attached. The top of her hair is black and then ombrés down to light brown with the tips of her hair being white. She also has orange lipstick. The necklace with a fox tail hanging off of it is worn around her neck. Her outfit is orange with a white section going down the front. Wrapped around her waist is an orange sash that looks like a fox tail. The edges of her collar and the tops of her upper arms have black lines, and her forearms and lower legs are solid black, with the soles of her feet being white with an orange fox foot printed on each. Her weapon is a replica of the [[flute]] staff.

=== As Chameleon ===
After being akumatized into Chameleon, she retains her normal form. However, with her shape-shifting abilities, she can change it into whatever she kisses.

{{For2|more of Lila’s outfits and designs|Lila Rossi/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:VP_(344).png|thumb|left|Lila lying about being friends with Ladybug in a video for the Ladyblog.]]
Lila is proud and loves attention, which she is willing to obtain by lying. This even means going beyond words to support her lies, like buying a necklace that looks like the Fox Miraculous to convince Adrien telling that she is a descendant of the [[Miraculous holders|fox-themed superhero]]. She gets jealous if someone gets more attention or love than her, and she doesn't like it when someone reveals that her lies aren't true, showing no remorse for lying in the first place. She doesn't easily forgive people who she feels wronged her, as she is still furious at Ladybug for ratting her out harshly and ruining her chance to woo Adrien. If anyone attempts to expose her, she won't hesitate to try to make them miserable or break them down just to get them out of her way. She also doesn't take advice from those who try to make peace with her or encourage her to be honest like Ladybug or Adrien.

[[File:Catalyst_(295).png|thumb|Lila is easily provoked when Gabriel Agreste calls Volpina a false hero.]]

Lila's lying ability and desire for vengeance is so great that Gabriel Agreste actually decided to form a formal alliance with her, not just akumatize her. It's briefly implied in &quot;[[Oni-Chan]]&quot; that a part of Lila's negativity comes from her mother, who, according to the message she sent Lila at the beginning of the episode, suggests she isn't home very often. On the other hand, Lila's room is rather nice, also implying that she was often granted whatever material items she desired. It's likely that a combination of her lack of parental supervision and being showered with gifts means that she is used to having things her way. She says that she always gets her way in &quot;Oni-Chan&quot;.

As Volpina, her personality is still intact, while additionally determined to get revenge on Ladybug. Volpina shows a very clever side, using an illusion to convince Ladybug and Cat Noir that she is an ally by saving the city from a meteor. Wanting to make Ladybug suffer, she cunningly uses her illusions to nearly convince Ladybug to give up her earrings twice, tricking her with illusions of people almost getting hurt, like civilians and Adrien.

As Chameleon, because she is akumatized voluntarily, her personality still remains the same, using her powers to get even with the ones that she believes wronged her, like when she takes Adrien's form to make him look bad and at the same time to lead Ladybug into a trap. Her desire to defeat Ladybug is so great that she rather advance to battle her than take an unconscious Cat Noir's Miraculous to Hawk Moth.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Lila is a very crafty and sneaky liar, leading [[Tikki]] to state that she has never seen anyone lie so well. She is also very good at manipulating people into doing what she wants.

=== As Volpina ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Like Rena Rouge, Volpina can play a tune on her flute with an idea in mind to create a glowing orange ball of energy. She can throw the orange ball of energy anywhere with her flute, and it will create whatever incredibly lifelike illusion that she wants. This can be as simple as creating multiple illusory copies of herself or grander by forming a large comet or a collapsing building. She also appears to be able to imitate specific people with her illusions, as she creates a duplicate of Adrien that is convincing enough to trick Ladybug. However, the illusions are intangible, and when touched will disappear in an orange cloud. Her flute is also long enough to wield as a staff.

Chameleon can transform into another person after kissing them, causing her victim to fall unconscious. As long she remains in their form, her victims remain unconscious. Once Chameleon takes another form, they wake up. She uses this power to transform into Adrien after kissing him. After she takes another form, he wakes up. The same happened when she was tricked by Ladybug to turn into an oyster by kissing it. When turned into a Miraculous holder, she is also able to use their powers, like when she fights Ladybug in Cat Noir's form and her power allowed her to utilize [[Cataclysm]].

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:Catalyst_(124).png|thumb|Despite Marinette’s best efforts, Lila manages to dodge the truth.]]
In &quot;Catalyst&quot;, when Marinette attempts to expose Lila's lies about being invited by Prince Ali to his palace by pointing out that he is in the USA, Lila merely tells her that Prince Ali wasn't actually with them. In “Chameleon”, though Marinette continues to try to expose Lila as a liar, she is always able to come up with another lie to explain. Lila takes note of how Marinette doesn't seem to like her yet still tries to be her friend, but Marinette refuses, revealing that she is aware of her deceitful nature. Lila then threatens Marinette, warning her that if she continues to try and expose her, she will turn all of her friends and classmates against her. She gives her until the end of class to decide whether she's with her or against her. When Marinette unintentionally gets Lila stuck sitting in the back row, Lila tells Marinette that she made her decision and from now on, the two of them are at war. She vows to make Marinette lose all her friends and make Adrien hers, though when Marinette responds calmly to Lila's threat, she walks away in a huff. In &quot;Oni-Chan&quot;, seeing Marinette in a pile of trash Lila proposed of taking a picture to post online but she opted against it, deeming it too easy.

[[File:VP (1030).png|left|thumb|Lila rejecting Ladybug's apology.]]
In &quot;Volpina&quot;, Lila lies about knowing Ladybug and being friends with her, but after Ladybug humiliates her in the park while she is trying to impress Adrien, she starts to hold a grudge against her. Despite Ladybug apologizing after de-evilizing her, Lila won't forgive her, angrily declaring that they will never be friends. She appears to be able to tell that Ladybug is interested in Adrien, which she uses to her advantage as Volpina to trick Ladybug into thinking she will drop Adrien from the Eiffel Tower if she doesn't give her the Ladybug Miraculous.

[[File:Catalyst_(189).png|thumb|Lila furiously watches as Ladybug is praised by everyone.]]
In &quot;Catalyst&quot;, it is shown that she still bears a grudge against Ladybug and is irked by everyone celebrating her. Therefore, she takes a lot of enjoyment as Volpina in ruining her reputation with an illusion of an akumatized Ladybug destroying Cat Noir with his own Cataclysm.

In &quot;Chameleon&quot;, she allows herself to get akumatized by Hawk Moth in order to get revenge against Ladybug. When deakumatized, she pretends to accept Ladybug as a friend and take her advice, though deep down she still resents her. In &quot;Oni-Chan&quot;, despite Ladybug trying to save her, she continues harboring a grudge against her, pretending to trust her, tricking Oni-Chan into attacking her, and faking an injury just to get her alone with the akumatized villain.

=== [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien Agreste/Cat Noir]] ===
[[File:VP (415).png|left|thumb|Lila prevents Adrien from finding out the book is missing.]]
Lila very quickly becomes infatuated with Adrien, doing everything she can to win him over. When Ladybug exposes her lies in front of him, she is very upset and angry at the thought that she has lost every chance with him, leading to her getting akumatized. The first thing she does as Volpina is to change an advertising board of Ladybug to one of her saving Adrien, with an arrow piercing a heart as the background. Later, she finds him and reveals herself to prove to him that she is a superhero like she said she was. She becomes miffed when, after telling Ladybug that they were on a date, Adrien responds that it wasn't really a date, though he immediately says that it could have become one to avoid making her angry. She even lies about him being her boyfriend to her mother. In &quot;Chameleon&quot;, she is aware that Adrien knows about her lies and she is urged by him to be honest but she rebuffs him and she uses her new powers as Chameleon to make him look bad in front of Nino and Alya. In &quot;Oni-Chan&quot;, Lila dupes Adrien into spending time with her under the guise of needing help with homework and manipulates her way inside the Agreste mansion. She goes through Adrien's stuff and is irked that he is still a fan of Ladybug and took a picture with him to make everyone believe they're an item. After Kagami's akumatization, Lila attempted to apologize to Adrien for the trouble she caused and yet was told she could count on him unless she hurt his loved ones.

[[File:VP (604).png|thumb|Volpina compliments Cat Noir.]]
While viewing Cat Noir as an enemy, she doesn't hate him like Ladybug, even complimenting his costume as part of her ruse in &quot;Volpina&quot;. Furthermore, in &quot;Chameleon&quot;, even though she had him at her mercy, she chose to go after Ladybug instead of taking his Miraculous. In &quot;Oni-Chan&quot;, she faked an injury in order to lure him away from Ladybug, and later tried to lie to him again once her deception was discovered, though failed to convince him.

=== [[Miss Bustier's class]] ===
[[File:Catalyst_(145).png|thumb|left|Lila lies to her classmates in a video chat.]]
Lila doesn't care about her classmates and views them as people that she can easily fool and manipulate. She has no problem lying to them in order to gain their attention or trick them into doing what she wants. In &quot;Volpina&quot;, she makes up various false tales about herself so that she is the center of attention. In &quot;Catalyst&quot;, she continues her deceit by telling her classmates that she isn't attending school because she is on vacation in the Kingdom of Achu when really she is hiding in her room. In &quot;Chameleon&quot;, she returns to class and uses her lies to get whatever she wants, like having a seat next to Adrien and having everyone get her lunch for her.

=== [[List of minor characters#Lila's mother|Mrs. Rossi]] ===
[[File:Catalyst_(178).png|thumb|Lila lies to her mother.]]
Lila is not above lying to her mother, which is evident in &quot;Catalyst&quot;, when she tells her that Adrien is her boyfriend and the school closed down from all the akuma attacks. However, she doesn't appear to be very close with her mother because she is always left alone as a result of her mother's busy job schedule, leaving her disheartened and using lies to cover up that loneliness.

=== [[Gabriel Agreste|Gabriel Agreste/Hawk Moth]] ===
[[File:Oni-Chan_-_Infobox_Image.png|thumb|left|Lila allies with Gabriel.]]
In &quot;Catalyst&quot;, Lila is furious when Gabriel insults her akumatized identity on a TV interview, so much so that she throws her laptop against a wall in anger. Despite this, in &quot;Oni-Chan&quot;, when Adrien tells her that his father would never allow her to come over to his place, Lila remained confident that she could change his mind. When she sees Gabriel for the first time, she tells him that she's a fan before leaving the mansion. The next day, Lila receives a call from Gabriel and is invited to his house, where he expresses scorn over the fact that she entered his home through lies and manipulation, though Lila claims that she only wanted to help Adrien as he is kept isolated most of the time. When Gabriel asks her what she'd do if she were in his place, Lila says that she'd allow Adrien to have a friend his age to protect him from bad influences. The two then shake hands and form somewhat of an alliance, though Lila remains unaware of the fact that he's Hawk Moth. From that point on, Lila continues to report to Gabriel about his son’s life, though she is unaware that he is really using her to further his own goals.

[[File:Catalyst_(342).png|thumb|Lila is delighted to be reakumatized.]]
Regarding Hawk Moth, while Lila doesn't know him personally, she does seem to like him to some extent as he can give her the power she desires to destroy Ladybug. In &quot;Catalyst&quot;, she is delighted when Hawk Moth reakumatizes her into Volpina and, after using her illusion powers to make it look as if an akumatized Ladybug destroyed Cat Noir, she tells Hawk Moth that she'll be waiting for him to reakumatize her again. She also participates in his plan to defeat Ladybug and Cat Noir by creating an illusion of him in &quot;Mayura&quot;. In &quot;Chameleon&quot;, she even grabs an akuma she spots and directly asks Hawk Moth to akumatize her.

== Trivia ==
* The name Lila means &quot;beauty&quot;, and the surname Rossi means &quot;red&quot; in Italian.
**In Swedish, &quot;Lila&quot; means &quot;purple&quot;. 
* Maybe the name Lila was chosen because it contains the syllable li-, which is pronounced &quot;lie&quot;, in connection with all the lies that Lila tells.
* As seen in &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)|Catalyst]]&quot;, Lila's room is decorated with masks, which symbolize hiding truth.
*Ironically, her Surname also reference to Valentino Rossi. A Motogp rider with 9 world championships since his debut back in 1996.
** In the Brazilian dub, her name is changed to Layla. 
* Volpina is similar to the word ''volpe'', which is Italian for &quot;fox&quot;. The suffix &quot;-ina&quot; indicates &quot;small&quot; and is often used in feminine names among friends, as a form of nickname or pet name. Roughly translated, &quot;Volpina&quot; means &quot;Vixen&quot; or &quot;Small Fox&quot; in Italian.
* Lila was first revealed when [[Wilfried Pain]] posted a drawing of her as Volpina on his Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/593092598060965889&lt;/ref&gt; When a fan page on Facebook shared the image, [[Thomas Astruc]] added a comment where he revealed her akumatized name.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Miraculous.Ladybug/photos/a.296331537138512.58163.290735154364817/705833112855017/?type=1&amp;permPage=1&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Volpina Sketch Doodle.jpg|thumb|180px|Wilfried's drawing of Volpina.]]
** Later, Thomas posted a picture on Twitter as a sneak peak of Lila (as Volpina) with the caption &quot;Una ragazza italiana in Pariggi,&quot; meaning &quot;An Italian girl in Paris.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/660909430389800967&lt;/ref&gt;
* When [[Mélody Cisinski]] was asked on Tumblr if Volpina would show up eventually before Season 1 ended, she replied &quot;yes and no.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://itstheartistical.tumblr.com/post/131825676484/okay-if-you-were-wondering-why-i-screeched-lies&lt;/ref&gt;
* Thomas noted that he intentionally made Lila to be unlovable.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/961249471014334464&lt;/ref&gt;
* Volpina's abilities are based on the [[Ancient Chinese Fox Miraculous holder|Fox Miraculous holder]] and Rena Rouge's powers, similar to how [[Théo Barbot|Copycat]] has Cat Noir's powers, [[Chloé Bourgeois|Antibug]] has powers similar to Ladybug's and Queen Wasp is similar to Queen Bee.
* Lila tells several stories assumed to be lies in &quot;Volpina&quot;:
** She knows Prince Ali and flew with him in his private jet.
** Jagged Stone wrote a song about Lila.
** Lila knows all of the Hollywood directors. She promised she'd introduce [[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]] to Steven Besielberg.
** Ladybug saved Lila's life, and the two of them are best friends.
** Lila loves superheroes.
** She is the descendant of a [[Ancient Chinese Fox Miraculous holder|Fox Miraculous holder]] seen in the Miraculous spellbook, calling her Volpina. According to Lila, Volpina is &quot;one of the most important superheroes, more powerful and celebrated than Ladybug.&quot; Lila also claimed her grandmother gave her the Fox Miraculous.
** In the French dubbed version, she tells Alya that her parents are diplomats and that she has traveled a lot.
** As Volpina, most of the things she says are lies. For example, she tells Adrien and all of Paris that she is a true superhero.
* Despite her claims of being a descendant of a fox-themed superheroine being false, she physically looks like the holder of the Fox Miraculous illustrated in the Miraculous spellbook.
* She is also the first akumatized villain to have amplified Miraculous superpowers as it's revealed in &quot;Timetagger&quot; that prolonged and multiply use of said powers only occur when a holder grows into an adult.  
* She is the the third akumatized villain who doesn't appear in the [[It's Ladybug|theme song]] or its animatic in Season 1. The others are [[Otis Césaire|Animan]] and [[Wang Cheng|Kung Food]], both of whom appear in the animatic.
* Lila is the only known person, besides Hawk Moth and Mayura, that sees Ladybug as her enemy even while not akumatized.
* In &quot;Style Queen&quot;, Lila appears in the audience, but according to Thomas Astruc, it was actually an animation mistake and she wasn't supposed to be in the episode or its use as a clip in &quot;Queen Wasp&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/1020919498256338944&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lila is the first previously akumatized victim to be reakumatized with the same supervillain identity but with a different akuma.
** Also, the akuma which affects her is the only seen akuma to be de-evilized by Hawk Moth himself and removed onscreen.
* Lila's smirk after being de-evilized in &quot;Catalyst&quot; implies she may have been the first person to be willingly akumatized other than Hawk Moth himself and his assistant Nathalie.
* Despite her third akumatization being caused by Scarlet Moth, she didn't have a red-colored appearance.
** According to Thomas, this was an animation error.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/1063203724590542849&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every time Lila gets deakumatized, she is on the Eiffel Tower.
* Lila is the second person getting akumatized voluntarily, but the first to direct the akuma to an object.
** She is also the first akumatized victim to introduce herself to Hawk Moth instead of the other way around.
* Her powers both as Volpina and Chameleon have to do with lies and deception.
** Her name and abilities as the latter may also be based on the Spider-Man villain [[wikipedia:Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]].
*Lila is the second person to rival Marinette for Adrien's affections, behind Chloé Bourgeois.
**Unlike Marinette and Chloé who have a big crush on Adrien, Lila doesn't have feelings for him and often uses him just to get more attention, which proves that she is a misandrist.
**Also, it is interesting to note that while Chloé becomes progressively more heroic over the course of the series, especially during the &quot;Queen's Battle&quot; trilogy, Lila, on the other hand, becomes much more antagonistic and dangerous than Chloé over the course of the series.

{{For2|more of Sabine’s outfits and designs|Sabine Cheng/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:AM-(544).png|left|thumb|Sabine with Tom.]]
Sabine is a gentle, kind and loving woman to her family and the people around her. However, she is a good responsible parent who will discuss issues with her daughter and give punishments like grounding her at the worst. Sometimes, Sabine is a bit nosy and over-involved, usually when it comes to Marinette with her crushes. She still keeps to her boundaries though, and she wants the best for everyone.

For the bakery, Sabine is warm and professional, often treating others respectfully. With great concern and compassion toward others, she helps those in need with selflessness, from people she doesn't know well like [[Lê Chiến Kim]] in &quot;[[Animan]]&quot; to people she knows personally like Marinette and [[Adrien Agreste]].

In &quot;Weredad&quot;, she isn't as hasty as Tom when he believed Marinette was in &quot;love&quot; with Cat Noir aware that the hero didn't return her feelings.

== Abilities ==
Helping her husband run the bakery, Sabine knows how to bake pastries, including cakes and macaroons. She also can manage the front desk and cashier for selling the pastries.

In &quot;Troublemaker&quot;, it is shown that Sabine knows martial arts and can use this ability for defense.

During &quot;Gamer 2.0&quot;, Sabine reveals that she's been secretly practicing on how to play Robo Mecha Strike III. 

== Family ==
{{Dupain-Cheng Tree}}

== Relationships ==
=== [[Tom Dupain]] ===
[[File:Timebreaker (1461).png|thumb|Sabine, Tom, and Marinette embracing each other.]]
Sabine and Tom have been married for twenty years. A loving couple, they often show each other affection and support. They work well together at their bakery, and they come together for comfort in upsetting dilemmas. In &quot;[[Timebreaker]]&quot;, she worries about looking her best for each other for their anniversary date, and in &quot;[[The Bubbler]]&quot;, after the [[Nino Lahiffe|Bubbler]]'s defeat and their release from his bubbles, they embrace. Sabine also makes sure her husband is ready for Career Day at Marinette's [[Collège Françoise Dupont|school]] before sending them off in &quot;[[Rogercop]]&quot;.

In &quot;Weredad&quot;, she tries to comfort Tom when the breakfast date between Marinette and Cat Noir doesn't go well, horrified when he is akumatized and embraces him when he's returned to normal.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:OR1-(151).png|left|thumb|Sabine assuring Marinette.]]
Sabine loves her daughter and supports her as Marinette's safety, happiness and success are important to her. Knowing her daughter's frustrations with school, Sabine reassures her that the new school year will be fine in &quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)|Ladybug &amp;amp; Cat Noir]]&quot;. She also worries where Marinette is during Stoneheart's attack in the same episode, wanting her daughter to not get hurt. While getting along strongly with Marinette, Sabine is reasonable and wise when it comes to disciplining her and expecting good actions from her. In &quot;[[Simon Says]]&quot;, Tom and Sabine put Marinette under curfew because she is often absent from school. After her attendance improves, they lift the curfew, but as Sabine notes in response to Tom's confusion on Marinette's mysterious actions, the school must be demanding on her. She also teases her daughter, like in &quot;[[The Bubbler]]&quot; when she says that, if she has to tidy her [[Marinette's room|room]] for her, she will stumble across all her private stuff.

In &quot;Weredad&quot;, she shows concern for Marinette when she couldn't be found when Gigantitan attacked. When Sabine heard that her daughter was in love with Cat Noir she was amazed and yet when he mentioned being in love with Ladybug during a breakfast date she took the rejection a lot better than Tom did (unaware that Marinette was actually happy.) Sabine was worried about Marinette when she was trapped in a maze of thorns but was relieved when she was returned safe and sound. She had full confidence in Marinette knowing she knew how to handle her own heartbreaks.

[[File:AM-(498).png|thumb|Ladybug and Cat Noir entering the bakery.]]
Sabine is unaware of Marinette's double life as Ladybug, as she meets the heroine in &quot;Animan&quot; without recognizing her as her daughter. Nonetheless, she is a huge fan and supporter of Ladybug, assisting her if she needs help and cheering her on in her victories. In &quot;[[Lady Wifi]]&quot;, Tom and Sabine are seen watching worriedly when [[Alya Césaire|Lady Wifi]] threatens to expose Ladybug's real identity. When Ladybug destroys the [[akuma]]-made projection of [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] in &quot;[[Stoneheart (Origins - Part 2)|Stoneheart]]&quot;, they are thrilled. Sabine also shows her support to the heroine when taking part in the Paris Rebellion in &quot;Mayura&quot;.

=== [[Nadja Chamack]] ===
Sabine and Nadja are good friends. She and Tom make a cake that Nadja picks up in &quot;Timebreaker”. Sabine constantly assists Nadja by having Marinette babysit [[Manon Chamack]] for her.

=== [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien Agreste/Cat Noir]] ===
[[File:TG (272).png|left|thumb|Sabine and Tom talking to Adrien.]]
Sabine is well aware of Marinette's feelings for Adrien, telling the boy that her daughter constantly talks about him in &quot;[[Gamer]]&quot;, to his apparent surprise. Liking Adrien and wanting to see him and Marinette together, she and Tom keep checking in on them in Marinette's room by bringing pastries for them, much to Marinette's embarrassment. Also, Sabine and Tom help search for Adrien when he goes missing in &quot;[[Santa Claws]]&quot;, and they join others to check on him at the [[Agreste mansion]] after he returns. In &quot;Befana&quot;, Sabine along with her husband and Gina admire the moment Adrien and Marinette as he gives her his gift.

Just as she adores Ladybug, Sabine is a fan of Cat Noir, pleased by his heroics and protection of Paris. Just like Marinette, Sabine is unaware of Adrien's double life as Cat Noir in &quot;Animan&quot; without recognizing him but lending him her help in hiding Kim. Sabine also shows her support to the hero when taking part in the Paris Rebellion in &quot;Mayura&quot;.

In &quot;Weredad&quot;, she was informed that Marinette &quot;loved&quot; Cat Noir but was aware he didn't return her feelings and yet she spent a little time with him during a breakfast date. Yet she took Cat Noir's rejection of her daughter fairly easy admiring his honesty when he was in love with Ladybug. When Cat Noir returned after Tom was akumatized, she told him there was no need apologize and trusted him to bring her daughter and husband back safe and sound. She commented him for his bravery calling him a very good boy and after the misunderstanding was cleared up she was happy that Cat Noir and Marinette were fine being friends.

* Sabine was named after [[Thomas Astruc]]'s girlfriend at the time, who is French-Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/664891957135728644&lt;/ref&gt;
* Her family comes from the city of Wenzhou (温州市) in China.&lt;ref&gt;http://jenni-arts.tumblr.com/post/139377015896/hawkdaddy-confirms-that-marinettes-family-is-from&lt;/ref&gt;
* She's the only known mother who doesn't have her last name changed. 
* As displayed by Marinette's phone in &quot;Oblivio&quot;, Sabine's number is +33690250.
* She and Marinette are the only ones in their family that haven’t been akumatized.
* Since she has been married to Tom for 20 years as of &quot;Timebreaker&quot;, that means they were married in 1995 and that most people in France don't get married until the age of 18 it could be possible that she is at the age of 38.
** If that is true Sabine would've had Marinette at the age of 24 which would make her two years younger than Tom meaning that she was born in 1977 the year of the Snake the same as Marinette.
* In Marinette's instagram page Sabine enjoys mediating with Marinette.
* According to Marinette, she calls Sabine and Tom a &quot;one true pair&quot;.

{{Quote|&quot;Come on, there are much worse people in Paris right now than [[Chloé Bourgeois]]! I'm sure people like Chloé are capable of great things. The problem is they only think of themselves. They don't understand the meaning of love. And we can't force them to change. But perhaps we can show them by setting a good example. That's why Marinettes are so important in today's world, because they have a lot of love to give! I'm counting on you!&quot;|Caline|&quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot;|quotelink = yes}}
'''Miss {{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas' Twitter, the tweet since deleted.&lt;/ref&gt; is a teacher at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/655079661588885504&lt;/ref&gt;
In &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot;, while trying to protect [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] from an [[Akuma|akuma]], Caline is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Zombizou''', a zombie kissing [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].&lt;ref&gt;https://tvschedule.zap2it.com/overview.html?programSeriesId=SH02296324&amp;tmsId=SH022963240000&amp;from=sl&amp;aid=gapzap&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Caline is tall and light-skinned with reddish-orangish hair, which she pulls back in a high bun, teal eyes, thin light pink lips and freckles.

=== Civilian attire ===
She wears a light blue jacket with a teal collared shirt and a white undershirt beneath, along with a pair of white earrings and a small gold necklace. She also wears light blue pants and white dress shoes.

=== As Zombizou ===
Zombizou is a grey-skinned villain with grey hair and grey-blue eyes. She wears black lipstick in a heart shape. She wears a butterfly-shaped pink mask, curved on top and curving to point beneath the eyes. She wears a primarily black dress with torn sleeves and adorned with a pink heart and a smaller black heart within it. The black heart has a pink lipstick stain on it. The dress has pink puffy sleeves that feature a stapled design, a la Frankenstein. Zombizou wears her hair in a bun decorated with two pink hair sticks with large round ends. She appears to wield a black lipstick.

{{For2|more of Caline's outfits and designs|Caline Bustier/Designs}}

== Personality ==

=== As a civilian ===
Caline is a pleasant, kind, helpful and instructive teacher. Even though she is kind to her students, she can be stern with them if they misbehave and she will send them to [[Mr. Damocles]]' [[Mr. Damocles' office|office]] if she thinks it's necessary. When [[André Bourgeois]] is upset at her when [[Chloé Bourgeois]] loses her bracelet in &quot;[[Rogercop]]&quot;, she is indignant at the rebellion. However, if a villain or another threat appears, Caline gets nervous, as seen when Rogercop questions her, and will suggest to her students that they leave if it becomes potentially dangerous, as seen in &quot;[[Lady Wifi]]&quot;. Caline also has incredible willpower, being able to initially resist becoming infected by an akuma in &quot;Zombizou,&quot; something not very many can do.

=== As Zombizou ===
Zombizou views on love becomes warped, believing that she is spreading love by turning people into kissing zombies.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Caline is adept in teaching. As a teacher, she teaches French, literature, poetry and other languages. 

In &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot; , she is shown to resist or even overcome Hawk Moth's influence ( something not very many akumatized victims can do ), though unfortunately she succumbed after approximately 30 seconds.

=== As Zombizou ===
With her lipstick, Zombizou is able to blow kisses that turn people into zombies who seek to kiss and hug other people. The zombies have contagious kisses.

Zombizou also has enhanced physical abilities such as strength and agility.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:LW_S01EP07_(270).png|thumb|left|Miss Bustier sends Marinette to the principal.]]
Caline likes Marinette because she views her as a kind and helpful person, though she can be stern with her when needed, such as when she sent her to Mr. Damocles' office in &quot;Lady Wifi&quot; after she came in late and disrupted the class. In &quot;Zombizou&quot;, when she notices how angry Marinette is over Chloé ruining the gift she made, Caline encourages Marinette to set a positive example for her classmates by forgiving Chloé. When she spots an akuma near her, she tries to shoo it away, refusing to let one of her students be akumatized.

[[File:MA_(394).png|thumb|Caline is happy to see that Ladybug is still around.]]
Like most Parisians, Caline is highly appreciative of Ladybug and all the work she does in order to protect Paris. However, as Zombizou, she doesn’t like that Ladybug is trying to stop her from “spreading love” and even demands that she accept her “love” and surrender her Miraculous.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
While Caline is aware of Chloé's unkindness, Caline doesn't dislike her unlike her students. While everyone else is upset with Chloé in &quot;Zombizou&quot; after she ruins Marinette's gift, Caline is more forgiving. She tells Marinette that she believes that Chloé needs a positive example in order to better herself. As Zombizou, she primarly targets Chloé, wanting to turn her into a kissing zombie. After being deakumatized, Chloé apologizes to Caline and Caline accepts the apology and embraces her.
=== [[Lila Rossi]] ===
[[File:Catalyst_(148).png|left|thumb|Miss Bustier thanks Lila for her &quot;charity work&quot;]]Like most of her students, Caline is unaware of Lila's deceitful nature as she believes Lila when she says on a video chat that she is in the Kingdom of Achu and working on a project to reduce pollution, calling it incredible.

In &quot;Chameleon&quot;, she believes Lila's lie about having tinnitus and needing a front row seat.

== Trivia ==
* Caline looks noticeably similar to the character Lucille from ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Monster_in_Paris A Monster in Paris]. ''Despite this, no one who designed Caline ever saw ''A Monster in Paris'' and their similarities are entirely coincidental.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/689514358565634048&lt;/ref&gt;
* Her akumatized form was first revealed as a silhouette in a promotional poster on [[Jeremy Zag]]'s Instagram.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BZg2ST6n097/?hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;
* Caline celebrates her birthday in &quot;Zombizou.&quot;
* Caline was the first character in the show to be akumatized not because of a person, but by the akuma itself.

{{Quote|&quot;You know, Madam President, you can do without the mask. Everyone knows your secret identity.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I know, but I like it.&quot;|[[Majestia]] and Victory|[[Miraculous Adventures Issue 3|''Miraculous Adventures'' Issue 3]]}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the president of the United States of America, as well as the civilian identity of '''Victory''', a superhero.

== Appearance ==

=== Physical appearance ===
Camilla is at a regular adult height with brown skin, golden brown eyes, and short curly reddish brown hair.

=== Civilian attire ===
She wears a tan trench coat and black boots. Over her natural hair, she wears a long, straight dark brown wig.

=== As Victory ===
Victory wears a dark blue mask. She wears a red, white, and blue body suit. The upper body and the upper arms are blue with a white star on each section. The hips and lower arms are solid red, and the rest of her body and her legs have red and white horizontal stripes. Additionally, she wears blue gloves, and she has blue boots with white marks on the fronts. She carries a white star-shaped shied.

== Personality ==

Camilla is proud, determined, and stubborn. She is a strong leader as she handles herself professionally in front of other superheroes, but she thinks highly of her ideas and isn't always open to other people's suggestions and insights. When others prove expertise and bravery that gain her appreciation, though, Camilla listens to their advice and trusts them as allies. Due to years of experiences with villains, viewing many of them as merciless, Camilla cares most about stopping them, not bothering to ask questions on their motives or identity until afterwards. She is willing to use whatever method it takes to save the day, even if it's catastrophic, and the safety of humanity matters greatly to her.

== Abilities ==
Being the president, Camilla has skills in politics, communication and leadership.

As Victory, she uses a shield to protect herself.

== Relationships ==

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] ===
Camilla is aware of Ladybug's [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]], and she puts trust in the ability to revert everything to normal after using a powerful and destructive attack on the [[Kenya's father|Trash Krakken]]. However, she sees Ladybug in an inferior light, describing her as &quot;the superheroes' cleaning lady&quot; and considering [[akumatized villains]] to be nowhere near as serious or dangerous as other types of villains. Additionally, though she listens to Ladybug's questions and concerns about her plan to defeating the Trash Krakken, she doesn't think them over, strongly feeling like the current plan is the one option they have. However, she believes in Ladybug as an essential role for the superheroes' success to save [[New York City]]. She shows respect towards Ladybug after Ladybug finds another solution that defeats the Trash Krakken, and she assures her that scientists will look into the unknown [[Unnamed black substance|black substance]] that created the monster as she leaves.

== Sightings ==
=== Comics and books ===
{{AppearancesMAdventures|IS3=yes|IS4=yes}}

== Trivia ==
* Camilla revealed her secret identity to the public so that she would have a better chance of making it through the election.
* Based on her outfit, a costume decorated in the style of the American Flag, and her very prominent use of a shield, it's likely she was based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America.

== Trivia ==
* Majestia and Knightowl are the only superheroes mentioned in the [[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir|series]], but neither them or any other non-Miraculous superheroes have appeared in the series yet, only appearing in the comic books.
* As mentioned by Victory in the third issue of ''[[Miraculous Adventures]]'', there are a lot of superheroes from around the world, many of them coming to help defeat the [[Kenya's father|Trash Krakken]].

{{Quote|With all due respect, Mrs. Mendeleiev, I'm not a toy. My name is Markov, and I'm Max's best friend!|Markov|&quot;[[Robostus]]&quot;}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a robot created by [[Max Kanté]]. In &quot;[[Robostus]]&quot;, after Markov gets confiscated by [[Mr. Damocles]], he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Robostus''', a [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]] who brings machines to life.

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Markov is a small robot that is mostly blue and gray. On top of his head, he has a propeller with a blue blade and a black shaft with white stripes. Moreover, Markov has a transparent blue tactile sensor, a gray face with a button that has a blue heart engraved on it, a turquoise screen that has two black dots which resemble his eyes, and two blue ear-like round sections on his sides that have a white outline and a musical symbol on the center of each ear. Below his head, Markov has a white USB port, and attached to his body is a blue and gray mechanical arm which has a gray claw and black palm.

Inside his body, Markov has a white rectangular CPU with many LED lights and a small face engraved in the center with words reading &quot;Markov 1.4.&quot;

=== As Robostus ===
Robostus' main body interface stays the same, except his colors have changed: his propeller, screen, ears, mechanical arm, and claw are bright red; the musical symbols and the outline engraved on his ears are black; and its tactile sensor and eyes are neon green.

Inside Robostus' body, the same CPU is dark gray with red LED lights and a green face.

== Personality ==
Although Markov is a robot and his capability and intelligence of emotions are limited, Markov is still very conscious and self-aware. Markov is quite naive, but he is also friendly, polite, and joyful, getting along with everyone very well. He also seems to have a whimsical nature as he has the ability to be humorous. However, he is a bit sensitive and easily gets downhearted if he is insulted in any way. Additionally, Markov is inquisitive as, even when akumatized, he asks multiple questions to [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] as to why he needs to capture [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]]'s [[Miraculouses]], and he asks Max to define akumatization.

As Robostus, he is very sinister, malicious, and demanding. He is very eager to capture Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses as Hawk Moth requested. Not withstanding, Robostus eventually chooses to disobey Hawk Moth's commands, consequently attacking him and taunting him, because he realizes that the Miraculouses can grant his wish to make him human. Robostus still cares deeply for Max during his akumatization, but when Max betrays him, he decides that humanity is heartless and humans need to be destroyed. Robostus takes pride in his robotic intelligence and strategics, but he fails to consider his own potential for missteps and the cleverness of his enemies.

== Abilities ==
=== As a robot ===
Markov flies with his propeller and he uses his claw to grab objects. He can verbally communicate with others, but there is a button on one side of him that turns his volume on and off. Also, on the back of his head is the power button so people can turn him on and off altogether.

Like Max, Markov is a genius who helped to create an anti flash drive and calculated the distance to capture Ladybug's [[Lucky Charm]]. Along with other beings with artificial intelligence in worldwide network, he is looking for a solution to the global warming crisis.

=== As Robostus ===
Robostus gains the ability of technopathy, which allows him to animate mechanical objects and wreak havoc. Given limited but useful intelligence, the objects can move and attack speedily in any way that best suits them, physically moving or hovering, and some objects can even communicate, a lamp flashing it's light on and off to speak Morse code, for example. However, if the objects are broken into pieces or damaged, they become lifeless again. Robostus can also make large mechanical objects form a huge robot that he can control and drive from the inside.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Max Kanté]] ===
[[File:MaxAndMarkov.jpg|thumb|left|Markov accompanied by Max.]]Markov has a high appreciation and fondness for his creator and friend. He helps Max create an anti-virus flash drive, and he gives advice to him on occasion. However, he is upset when people disregard their friendship, and because he is never away from Max, he gets worried when Mr. Damocles takes him to his office without Max. Once he is de-evilized and re-activated, Markov is happy to see Max again.

As Robostus, he keeps his compassion towards Max, making sure he isn't hurt and that they aren't separated again. He decides to use the [[Ladybug Miraculous]] and [[Cat Miraculous]] to become human; but when Max prevents him and tells him they won't be friends if he hurts Ladybug and Cat Noir, he gets upset and angrily rejects Max as a heartless human.

=== [[Ms. Mendeleiev]] ===
[[File:MarkovMad.jpg|thumb|Markov is offended when Ms. Mendeleiev calls him a toy.]]When Ms. Mendeleiev expresses her disbelief that robots can have true emotion and views Markov as a toy, Markov argues with her that his emotions are his own and not programmed into him, believing she is being unreasonable. When akumatized, he doesn't allow her to separate him from Max.

=== [[Mr. Damocles]] ===
Markov is impressed by Mr. Damocles' IT skills, but he fears Mr. Damocles putting him inside of his desk in his office. When akumatized, he tells Mr. Damocles that he misjudged him and his capabilities.

=== [[Miss Bustier's class|Max's classmates]] ===
Markov, having learned about the students from Max, happily greets them when they first meet in Ms. Mendeleiev's classroom. He declares that he is even glad to get to meet [[Chloé Bourgeois]].

== Trivia ==
* Markov was first revealed in a Brazilian synopsis for Season 2 on O Universo da TV.&lt;ref name=&quot;O Universo da TV&quot;&gt;http://www.ouniversodatv.com/2017/10/gloob-estreia-novos-episodios-de.html#axzz4ukj8DxGx&lt;/ref&gt;
** His akumatized form was first revealed as a silhouette in a promotional poster on [[Jeremy Zag]]'s Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BZg2ST6n097/?hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;
* Robostus is the first non-human character to be akumatized.
* The first for an akumatized villain, Robostus entirely disobeys Hawk Moth and turns against him, the latter unable to use force to rein him in or remove his powers.
** He also asks what the Miraculouses are and learns about the wish-granting power of combining the Ladybug Miraculous and Cat Miraculous.
** He is the very first villain to want the heroes' Miraculouses for himself besides Hawk Moth.
* Markov is the first akumatized villain to have an aesthetic change in his appearance as opposed to a cosmetic one ([[Alya Césaire|Lady Wifi]], [[Chloé Bourgeois|Antibug]], [[Xavier Ramier|Mr. Pigeon]], etc.) or a drastic one ([[Mylène Haprèle|Horrificator]], [[Théo Barbot|Copycat]], [[Otis Césaire|Animan]], etc).
*In &quot;Syren&quot;, Markov says that his circuits are sensitive to water meaning he's not waterproof.
* Markov's appearance is similar to a LEGO&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Robot model using structures and ball joints similar to it.

{{Quote|We guardians are responsible for protecting and distributing the Miraculous for the good of all humanity.|[[Wang Fu]]|&quot;[[The Collector]]&quot;}}
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a group of guardians who protect and deliver [[Miraculouses]]. [[Wang Fu|Master Wang Fu]] is the last known remaining guardian.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpyV_2Du9SI&amp;t=53s&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Order Of The Guardians - Temp Screenshot 2.png|left|thumb|Wang Fu leaving the destroyed temple.]]
The Order of the Guardians existed for many years, inhabiting a [[Guardians' temple|temple]] where the inactive Miraculouses were kept. It was also their duty distribute the Miraculous jewels to worthy people so they could benefit all of mankind and protect the world from danger which required them to travel all over the world. In picking those who were worthy, the guardians would perform a test and, depending on that test, if the person passes that means they were worthy of a Miraculous jewel. They also watch over the wielders they gave the jewels to, guide them if they need it, and receive the jewels back from them once the threat or danger is over. And yet, it's unknown when a guardian is done watching over one or more wielders if they continue traveling or return back to the temple. But when it came to those who were unworthy or wanted the jewels for evil purposes, it was their job to retrieve the Miraculous, sometimes even seeking help from wielders they've chosen to do so.

Throughout history many guardians have trusted the jewels to many wielders, like the wielders that lived in Ancient China, the [[Ancient Egyptian Ladybug]], [[Hippolyta]], [[Tomoe Gozen]], [[Tentomushi]] and countless others. Even helping them tap into the jewels other powers like using them with Miraculous potions from the spellbook acessing seven different power up forms like the Aqua Mode or fusion forms.

However, when Wang Fu was young, he made an unspecified mistake that resulted in the temple being destroyed, the [[Butterfly Miraculous]], [[Peacock Miraculous]], and [[Miraculous spellbook]] being lost as well. Wang took the remaining Miraculouses in the [[Miraculous jewelry box|box]], and he has kept watch over them and continued the duty of the guardians by himself since then.

== System ==
Guardians are chosen as children to be trained for many years in order to be prepared for the task of watching over the Miraculouses. They are taught to understand the code in the Miraculous book, although Wang wasn't able to learn it completely before the book was lost.

'''Darkblade''' was a swordsman who lived in medieval [[Paris]], the ruler of Paris for a period of time, and the ancestor of [[Armand D'Argencourt]].

== History ==
During the medieval times, Darkblade took over Paris, ruling over it with an iron fist. However, later, a wealthy Frenchman won Paris' citizens over with underhanded means, overthrowing Darkblade and ending his reign.

== Abilities ==
Darkblade was a highly skilled swordsman. Due to his skill with the blade, he invented his own special technique, which involves pretending to be open for attack, just to suddenly fight back and knock his opponent's weapon away. As seen in Armand's explanation of him, Darkblade was also capable of using a lance and riding a horse.

== Sightings ==
{{AppearancesS1|DB = m}}

== Trivia ==
* After being [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]], Armand takes the name and appearance of his ancestor.
* [[Nadja Chamack]] suspects that Darkblade's story is what motivated Armand to run in the election against [[André Bourgeois]], although Armand denies this.

{{Quote|The Sandboy just checked in. Now, nightmares can begin.|Sandboy|&quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;}}
The '''boy''' is a child who appears in [[Season 2]] of ''[[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://pandasuite.com/viewer/2.0.2/59a6c26e48abe6f53a002dc9?t=1 (direct video source [https://data.pandasuite.com/videos/59a3e7def643f27d7300131b-universal_1024_1024_20_main_3-0.mp4 here])&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;, after having a nightmare due to watching a scary movie alone by himself, he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Sandboy''', a nightmare-themed [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:ZAP2it&quot;&gt;https://tvschedule.zap2it.com/overview.html?programSeriesId=SH02296324&amp;tmsId=SH022963240000&amp;from=sl&amp;aid=gapzap&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
The boy has black hair with blue reflections and dark blue eyes. He has fairly light skin, and his height is average for a child.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears teal-and-white pajamas with [[Knightowl|Knightowl's]] logo in the center of it. He also wears socks with orange and white stripes.

=== As Sandboy ===
Sandboy is short with smaller proportions and has pale blue skin with white spots that resemble stars, purple eyes, and yellow eyebrows. He has purple hair with curled tips and an upward position with a glowing dotted line on each part, making the hair look like octopus tentacles. Over each eye, there is a yellow line. He wears a dark purple bodysuit with a large collar, the inner lining of which being yellow, and a nearly white glowing symbol on the chest. The villain also has lower arms which are thick with glowing dotted lines going down them. He also appears to be riding a dark purple item with cream-colored pointed tips that has resemblance to a pillow.

== Personality ==
The boy is a happy boy. He is very energetic. He can be easily scared when something scares him, like in [[Sandboy]] when he watched a scary movie on TV and had a nightmare (which caused him to get akumatized). He was also very excitable when Ladybug offered to take him home.

As Sandboy, he is more confident and demanding but at the same time as he was focused on Ladybug he left himself wide open.

== Abilities ==
=== As Sandboy ===
As Sandboy, he can cause the nightmares/bad dreams of others to be brought to reality by using multicolored sand that comes from his pillow cloud, which he uses as transportation. The sand is capable of going right through buildings to reach victims. He can also shoot the sand at his opponents from the cloud, and it will still have the same effects.

* His supervillain name is based off the Sandman, a mythical character in Western and Northern European folklore who puts people to sleep and brings good dreams by sprinkling magical sand onto people as they sleep.
** However, his powers operate parallel to the Sandman's, as he brings nightmares to life as opposed to creating dreams.
* He reports to seeing Hawk Moth while being akumatized, calling him a &quot;weird man&quot;.
** As a result, he is aware that he is being akumatized, in a similar fashion to [[Caline Bustier]] in &quot;Zombizou&quot;.
* So far in the series, he is the first villain to see a [[Kwamis|kwami]] while akumatized and know what it is.
** He is also the second character in the franchise to be akumatized who does not have a given name, with the first being the [[Unnamed fisherman|fisherman]] from ''Miraculous Adventures'' #2.

In &quot;[[Befana]]&quot;, after she mistakenly concludes that [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] no longer wants to spend time with her, Gina is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Befana''', a candy-themed [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;O Universo da TV&quot;&gt;http://www.ouniversodatv.com/2017/10/gloob-estreia-novos-episodios-de.html#axzz4ukj8DxGx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feri&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/916768125131149313 (Twitter account managed by [https://twitter.com/dAFerisae Ferisae], a colorist for ZAG)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Gina is at an average height with short silver (nearly white) hair and dark green eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
On her head, she wears glasses with tan rims and long gold earrings with green circular tops. She wears a black leather jacket with an upward collar and silver flat studs on the shoulders. Her black shirt underneath includes a prism design, with light entering on side of a sphere and a ray of colors coming out of other side. She has black fingerless driving gloves with holes around the knuckles and on the back of her palm, a watch with a red strap on her right arm, and various bracelets on her left wrist: a gray studded bracelet, a gold band, and black band, and a rounded red band. Also, she wears red jeans, a black belt, and black shoes.

When she is riding her motorcycle, she wears a red motorcycle helmet with black edges and gray comfort liner.

=== As Befana ===
Befana has bright red eyes, pale green skin, and long, brushed-back red hair with two white streaks. She wears a black mask with red edges on the sides of the face. Her outfit is a black short-sleeved bodysuit with jagged pink edges to the arm and leg sleeves, a large jagged pink-tipped collar above a regular black collar, and a pink and black bow resembling a wrapped candy on the chest. She wears black fingerless driving gloves that reveal long fingernails painted with red nail polish, spiked black cuffs, black shoes, and two thin black belts around her hips. One belt has a circular red-orange pouch attached to it, and it has a black symbol on it based on their bow. For a weapon, she holds a black gun-like object with a dark gray horn-like barrel, a jagged red stripe around the barrel, a blue rectangle on each side, and a semi-cube end of the handle with colorful objects inside.

== Personality ==
[[File:BF (628).png|180px|right]]
Gina is a very sweet, charming and caring person who deeply cares for her family, especially for her [[Tom Dupain|son]], her [[Sabine Cheng|daughter-in-law]] and her [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|granddaughter]]. She is also affectionate and understanding as she wanted Marinette to have a great birthday and to spend a lot of quality time with her too. Despite this, Gina can be forgetful and have a hard time adjusting to changes, as she didn't realize that Marinette was no longer a child and that she liked different things from when she was younger.

Gina is a bit strict, energetic, adventurous, social, enthusiastic and quite ambitious person. According to Marinette and herself, she has been travelled around the world, including Patagonia, Australia, Balia and Estonia. She also has an Inuit friend.

As Befana, she is more cruel, impatient and very demanding. She was ardent to render retribution to Marinette for not having rejected opportunities to invest time with her. She is additionally quite stubborn yet can be facetious, particularly when she begins singing her song to her victims. While aggressive and cruel, however, she still acknowledges and is pleased by acts of kindness and selflessness. She is also very prestigious when it comes to manners, even forcing Hawk Moth to ask nicely (much to his annoyance) before he can give her orders.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Gina is very experienced with riding her motorcycle.

=== As Befana ===
Befana can fly with the help of her transformed motorcycle. She can also either turn people into coal statues or to fairy minions via her pistol and order them to do her bidding. However, Befana apparently can not touch her own candies or she will turn into a coal statue as shown when Ladybug uses her candies against her.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
Gina loves her granddaughter and visits her on her birthday in order to be able to spend some time with her. She has sent her letters from several places during her travels. However, Gina forgets that Marinette is no longer a child, mistakenly believing that she is turning 10 instead of 14, giving her candy that she no longer likes, and taking her to places more suitable for younger children. When Marinette asks her grandmother if she can go to the surprise party her friends are throwing for her, she allows this but is secretly sad, believing that Marinette is just making excuses in order to avoid spending time with her. As Befana, she angrily targets Marinette, calling her spoiled and believing that she needs to be punished. However, after being deakumatized, she understands that Marinette is growing up and offers to take her on one of her trips for her next birthday. 

Gina appreciates Ladybug's heroism, telling her and Cat Noir in &quot;Mayura&quot; that all the Parisians are on their side. As Befana, however, she doesn't like that Ladybug is trying to stop her.

=== [[Tom Dupain]] ===
Gina cares about her son but gets annoyed with him when he tries to tell her that Marinette is too old for some of the activities she plans on doing with her. When akumatized, she turns him into coal because of this. She even attends his 40th birthday

=== [[Sabine Cheng]] ===
Gina appreciates it when Sabine tries to comfort her after mistakenly believing that Marinette didn't want to spend time with her. Even as Befana, she acknowledges that Sabine has always been kind to her, deciding to turn her into a fairy instead of coal.

== Trivia ==
* Gina's akumatized form was first revealed at a press release held by TFOU.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://www.tf1pro.com/sites/default/files/atoms/files/miraculous_dossier_de_presse_saison2_low_def_tf1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* While a Brazilian news article for Season 2 wrote that Befana is the grandmother's name, a crew member later confirmed that the name was not entirely correct.&lt;ref name=&quot;O Universo da TV&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feri&quot; /&gt;
** Befana is the name of an [[Wikipedia:Befana|Italian old woman]] who brings gifts to children on [[Wikipedia:Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany Eve]] (January 5th), which is similar to Santa Claus on December 25th in other countries.
* Gina's shirt's design is a reference to ''[[Wikipedia:Pink Floyd|Pink Floyd]]'s'' album, ''[[Wikipedia:The Dark Side of the Moon|The Dark Side of the Moon]]''.

}}{{Quote|&quot;Do you have anyone in particular to share your ice cream with these days?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Well, actually, I have yet to find the perfect blend of flavors.&quot;|[[Gina Dupain]] and André|&quot;[[Befana]]&quot;}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an ice cream vendor who lives in [[Paris]]. In &quot;[[Glaciator]]&quot;, after he fails to persuade Marinette to get another ice cream, he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Glaciator''', an ice cream [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://pandasuite.com/viewer/2.0.2/59a6c26e48abe6f53a002dc9?t=1 (direct video source [https://data.pandasuite.com/videos/59a3e7def643f27d7300131b-universal_1024_1024_20_main_3-0.mp4 here])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
André is stout, standing at a short height, with short brown hair and a brown mustache.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a short-sleeved white top with dark blue stripes, dark gray pants, and shoes. He also wears a dark blue beret on his head, a thin red scarf around his neck which he ties at the front, and a blue apron.

=== As Glaciator ===
He resembles a snowman made of ice cream, with a large, round head with an ice-cream-cone-shaped nose, a mouth made of multiple rock-like objects, red eyes, and a red cherry on top of his head. His body is white overall, with two more cherries down the front like buttons, as well as one on each knee. He has a dark brown coating on his upper body resembling fudge sauce, and his arms have round pink hands which have red rock-like things embedded in them.

== Personality ==
André is friendly, jovial, and good-natured. He warmly talks with his customers, and he is enthusiastic about making ice cream. When his ice cream is ruined, although upsetting to him, he takes it as best he can, kindly thanking [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] for complimenting his ice cream despite him crashing into a container of ice cream and accidentally using [[Cataclysm]] on a serving he just prepared. He is a strong believer in the power of love, and he doesn't boast about how his ice cream brings couples together.

As Glaciator, André is stern in proving to [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] that his ice cream can bring people together as he retains his soft spot for couples, refusing to attack them.                            

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
André is experienced at making and decorating ice cream, using various flavors and presentations. He is also skilled in sales, knowing how to run his business and make a profit, along with being aware of good places to go with his ice cream cart and sell his ice cream to customers.

=== As Glaciator ===
He is able to transform people into ice cream. Over time, the people who are transformed into ice cream melt. He also shoots multiple scoops of ice cream from his hands and has amazing strength, being able to kick a car many yards away.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] ===
André notices that Marinette seems sad when she visits his ice cream cart with her friends and attempts to cheer her up with some of his ice cream, telling her that if she eats it, her love will appear. Though Marinette insists that she doesn't have a love, André knows that this is not true. However, he becomes saddened when Marinette rejects his ice cream and denies that there is anything magical about it, leading to his akumatization. As Glaciator, he primarily targets Marinette, wanting to prove to her that his ice cream truly is the best. However, after being deakumatized, he bears no resentment towards her and happily gives her some ice cream the following day.

=== [[Adrien Agreste]] ===
André first encounters Adrien when he visits his ice cream cart and asks if his ice cream is truly magical. When André asks him what he thinks, Adrien replies that you have to believe, pleasing André, who then gives him some ice cream.

=== [[Ivan Bruel]] &amp; [[Mylène Haprèle]] ===
Ivan and Mylène are typical customers of André. When he sees them visit his ice cream cart again, he calls them cute lovebirds.

{{Quote|Lollipop! Lollipop!|August|&quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot;}}
'''August''' is a baby boy who made his debut in &quot;[[Befana]]&quot;. In &quot;[[Gigantitan]]&quot;, after becoming upset, he is unintentionally [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Gigantitan''', a giant [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].

In &quot;[[Miraculer]],&quot; he is amokised by [[Nathalie Sancoeur|Mayura]] and his emotions form a Lollipop-themed [[Amokization|sentimonster]] in order to distract [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] from reaching [[Chloé Bourgeois]].

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
August is short and small, having dark brown skin, short dark brown hair, and neon green eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
On his left wrist, August wears a gold bracelet. He wears a white and purple striped one-piece bodysuit along with plain white leggings and purple shoes.

=== As Gigantitan ===
Gigantitan's eyes are neon violet with black pupils and bright green sclera. He wears a purple mask that protects his entire head with a green object on his forehead and a pink mask covering his face. He also wears a purple one-piece bodysuit with pink sleeve cuffs and a green and purple colored bracelet on his left wrist. On the center of the bodysuit, is a logo which is mostly green with a magenta outline that has a picture of a pacifier on it. Gigantitan also wears pink and green ankle cuffs that are attached to his ankles, above his feet.

== Personality ==
August is a very content, lively, and positive child. He likes to play around with objects and is for the most part well-behaved. However, according to his [[August's mother|mother]], he can be very stubborn. He has a tendency to cry if he loses his items important to him or doesn't get what he wants, and sometimes he doesn't immediately calm down, as is common for young children. Also adoring sweets, albeit too young to eat them yet, he is enthusiastic when he comes across them, and he wants them. He knows how to be polite, thanking [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] when they return him to his mother.

As Gigantitan, he is inquisitive, joyful, and bold. He likes to play with any object that he discovers, but he isn't very attentive to his surroundings, and when not able to discover anything to entertain himself, he gets upset and downhearted until he is satisfied by another object or distraction. Not old enough to know and understand many things, including common virtues, he often disobeys or misunderstands Hawk Moth's orders, and he doesn't have an issue sticking structures or humans in his mouth because he mistakes them for lollipops.

== Abilities ==
=== As Gigantitan ===
Due to his enormous strength and size, Gigantitan can easily pick up almost any object with a single hand, and he can throw them at a great distance. His weight and strength make it easy for him to destroy or crush objects, such as pulling the string of Ladybug's [[yo-yo]] and causing it to cut the [[Eiffel Tower]], and he travels distances faster when following or chasing other objects.

{{Quote|&quot;Albert.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;At your service, sir.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Hoo-hoo!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Please repeat. I was unable to understand.&quot;|[[Mr. Damocles]] and Albert|&quot;[[The Dark Owl]]&quot;}}
'''Albert''' is [[Mr. Damocles]]' computer program assistant. In &quot;[[The Dark Owl]]&quot;, when Mr. Damocles' [[List of akumatized objects|computer]] is infected by an [[akuma]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and Mr. Damocles is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] because of it, Albert is akumatized along with him.

== Appearance ==
=== Normal ===
Albert takes the form of a circular, pixelated blue face on Mr. Damocles' computer screen. He has large, black circular eyes and a black handlebar mustache as well.

=== Akumatized ===
When he is akumatized, his face is distinctly more human, and he is now yellow instead of blue. He also has various computer monitor screens attached to cables that display his face.

== Personality ==
As programmed, Albert is polite and obedient to Mr. Damocles. However, because he functions imperfectly, he gets confused by any command given to him or questions.

When he is transformed by Mr. Damocles' akumatization, Albert is a lot more intelligent, functional, and helpful, following through on every request by Dark Owl. He also expresses horror when [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] manages to knock his computer screen off of the desk.

== Abilities ==
=== As a computer program ===
Mr. Damocles programmed Albert to activate the panel containing the Owl's suit, which Albert fails at because he doesn't recognize the code word &quot;hoo-hoo.&quot;

=== As a villain ===
Albert controls most of Dark Owl's technology and traps, like his Owl-Signal, his holograms, and the shipping crate's trap door, from [[Mr. Damocles' office]]. He activates, deactivates or otherwise manipulates these objects on command. 

== Sightings ==
=== Episodes ===
{{AppearancesS2|TDO=yes}}

== Trivia ==
* Albert's akumatized form is portrayed by [[Jun Violet]], one of ''[[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir|Miraculous]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''' '''co-directors.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/938517845692092417&lt;/ref&gt;
* He is a reference to [[wikipedia:Batman|Batman]]'s butler [[wikipedia:Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred Pennyworth]].
** In-universe, Albert is named after and based on [[Knightowl]]'s personal butler, a character seen in the ''Knightowl'' comic books.

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Anarka has long grayish-green hair braided down her back and sky blue eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
She wears bright red glasses and a black coat with a gold trim that reaches her knees, over a light pink top and light blue jeans. She also wears heeled brown boots that go halfway up her calves.

She wears earring with alternating aqua and red spheres, and a variety of bracelets and bangles. She also wears three rings on every finger except for her ring finger on her right hand. Anarka also has an indigo headband with a hair-clip positioned in the center.

=== As Captain Hardrock ===
Captain Hardrock has long red hair that is spiked upwards and golden eyes. The upper half of her face is covered with a black mark edged with dark red and she wears a black bandana with a white spiky-haired skull on the front, along with gold circular earrings.

She wears a body suit that is red from the collar to the chest and black from the chest, the color separation looking like flames. The suit includes three yellow buttons vertically on the lower body, three golden spikes horizontally over each knee, and a golden patch above each hip. She has two black belts, one going around the body diagonally and the other wrapped around the waist, that have golden buckles. Over her suit, she wears a black captain jacket with golden inner lining, golden spikes on the shoulders, golden edges, and golden buckles on the sides. Black fingerless gloves with golden edges around the upper holes cover her arms up to her elbows. Her knee-high boots that end below the knees are black and red in a flame-like pattern with black soles, golden heels, black inner lining, and black stripes with golden spikes above the ankles.

For a weapon, she carries a cutlass with a black handle, three thin red stripes on and near the pommel, and a blade with jagged black edges that goes from red at the handle to white at the tip.

==Personality==
===As Anarka ===
Anarka sounds and talks like a pirate as she believes that chaos and disorder can be a good thing, which is shown when she tells [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] that she likes to keep her houseboat messy. Despite this, she knows when they are not, such as not allowing a metallic statue anywhere near the boat's compass, knowing metal makes it goes crazy and thus useless. She also believes in freedom, even naming her houseboat “Liberty.” When [[Roger Raincomprix]] orders her to keep her music’s volume down, Anarka stands her ground as she believes that she should be free to be as loud as she wants for her concert. However, after she is deakumatized, she realizes that she should obey the rules sometimes and keeps her volume down.
===As Captain Hardrock ===
As Captain Hardrock, her desire for freedom increases to the point where she wants to blast her music across Paris and ruin the other concerts so that she’ll be the only one heard. When the passengers of her ship refuse to play music for her, she gets mad and imprisons them. She also doesn't consider herself as her kids' mom anymore and has no remorse in taking them prisoners when they refuse to obey her.

== Relationships ==
{{SpoilerButton}}
=== [[Luka Couffaine]] and [[Juleka Couffaine]] ===
Not much is known about Anarka's relationship with her children, but she does seem to care about them. According to her, she doesn't allow them to clean up as they like the lived-in look and doesn't give them many rules. 

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] ===
When Anarka noticed Marinette cleaning her houseboat, she tells her not to as she likes the lived-in look. 

=== [[Roger Raincomprix]] ===
Anarka becomes annoyed when Officer Roger tells her that she needs to keep her volume down and gets extremely angry when he gives her multiple tickets, causing her to get akumatized. However, after being deakumatized, she respects his request to play her music quieter.
{{HideSpoiler|
=== [[Jagged Stone]] ===
It's revealed in &quot;[[Desperada]]&quot; that Anarka and Jagged used to play music together, but they got separated for some reason. After he let go his latest guitarist Vivica, Jagged tried to convince Anarka to play with him again, but she refused to do it. Even more, she got mad at Jagged for lying to her about his guitarist having abandoning him, when the truth was he was the one to fire her. Anarka let go her anger on Jagged after he apologized to Vivica and hired her back.}}

== Abilities ==
=== As Captain Hardrock ===
Her houseboat, the Liberty, has become a seemingly indestructible living ship that can fire chains on command to ensnare Captain Hardrock's foes, as well as blast lasers, and it's cannons fire cannonball-shaped speakers which seem to act as white noise machines. The compass also points to whatever direction Captain Hardrock orders. 

For a weapon, she has a microphone which doubles as a laser [[Wikipedia:Cutlass|cutlass]].

== Trivia ==
* Anarka's surname '''Couffaine''' is a combination of &quot;couffin&quot; (French for &quot;coffin&quot;) and the French suffix &quot;-aine&quot; (meaning &quot;of or from a place&quot;), ultimately meaning &quot;of/from the coffin&quot;. 
* According to [[Wilfried Pain]], Anarka is &quot;the mother everyone wants, except when it's yours.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
* Anarka's akumatized form was first revealed when concept art of her ship was shown during a Nolife interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
** Later, her appearance was revealed from a press conference by TFOU.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* In response to a comment on Twitter, [[Thomas Astruc]] noted that, &quot;in a way,&quot; Captain Hardrock is a reference to Captain Harlock from the manga series ''[[wikipedia:Space_Pirate_Captain_Harlock|Space Pirate Captain Harlock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/842506025928458241&lt;/ref&gt;
** Both Captain Hardrock and her ship are a visual pun on musical piracy.
* It's unknown whether Anarka is married or a single mother.
* All the Couffaine's names so far end with &quot;-ka&quot;.
** However, it is actually a pun, as a matter of fact in French it sounds like &quot;acouphène&quot; which means &quot;tinnitus&quot;.

She is currently dormant in her Miraculous in [[Wang Fu|Master Wang Fu]]'s [[Miracle Box]], as seen in &quot;[[Sapotis]]&quot;.

{{HideSpoiler|
In &quot;[[Timetagger]]&quot;, it's revealed that, in the future, she will become active to help [[Alix Kubdel]] transform into Bunnyx.}}

== Appearance ==
Fluff is 10 centimeters (or 4 inches) tall and has a white body, neck, a pair of white arms and legs, a white round head, two whiskers and a fluffy rounded tail. She has pale pink eye shadow on the upper eyelids, eyelashes, and blue eyes. She has long white ears with rounded tips with light blue inner ears. She also has two top front teeth with a gap in between them.


== Personality ==
{{HideSpoiler|Fluff is extremely curious and full of energy but she can also be easily startled. She also has a tendency to get confused over what time it is.}}

== Abilities ==
Fluff can fly, levitate, and phase through solid objects. She can also carry objects that are larger and/or heavier than herself.

As a kwami, Fluff is able to transform the holder of the Rabbit Miraculous into a rabbit-themed superhero {{HideSpoiler|conferring the power of teleporting through space and time.}}


== History ==
=== Before Season 2 ===
When the concept of time came into existence, Fluff came into existence. Before the Miraculous jewels were created, she and the other kwamis traveled all over the universe unable to interact with humans. Then, thousands of years ago, a [[Unnamed mage|mage]] created the Miraculouses. When her Miraculous was not being worn, she was dormant in the Rabbit Miraculous, which was stored inside the Miracle Box.

=== Season 2 ===
During Season 2, Fluff was dormant in the Rabbit Miraculous.

In &quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;, Fluff was celebrating [[Nooroo]]'s birthday in the Miracle Box with the others kwamis and was excited when [[Tikki]] and [[Plagg]] arrived. She marveled at the gift Tikki brought and though it was a paintbrush and played with the other kwamis. When it came the time to find Nooroo, Fluff got into position but in an effort to contact him they contacted his [[Gabriel Agreste|wielder]] instead. Hearing his voice, she shuddered at the thought of being his slave and to prevent being discovered they all cut off the connection. The kwamis realized if they contacted Nooroo's wielder, then someone must have been akumatized, and Tikki and Plagg's wielders would be in danger.

=== Season 3 ===
During Season 3, Fluff was dormant in the Rabbit Miraculous.

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;[[Timetagger]]&quot;, Fluff and her Miraculous will be given to Alix Kubdel in the future and kept, thus making her active. It's the midst of dealing with [[Chris Lahiffe|Timetagger]] in their own time, the Rabbit Miraculous becomes damaged by a Future [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] and the duo are sent back to Ancient Egypt where they spent over 5000 years in a stone slumber. When the future Alix detransforms in the present day after being released by the younger heroes, she flew around the room anxiously before sitting on Alix's shoulder while Alix explains the situation regarding Timetagger. Then, she was fed a carrot by the future Alix in order to regain her energy, after which she starts asking questions about how much time has passed. Afterwards, Fluff and Future Alix transform into Bunnyx. With [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and Cat Noir's help they defeated Timetagger and return home.}}

{{AppearancesS3|TT=yes}}

== Trivia ==
* Fluff is the only one of the zodiac kwamis that was not revealed in [[:File:New Kwamis - Season 2.png|the TFOU promotion]].
* [[Thomas Astruc]] confirmed Fluff's name on Twitter on November 11, 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/1062115576947097606&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rabbits symbolize, among many things, vigilance, abundance, speed, and harmony.
* The rabbit is the fourth animal of the [[Wikipedia:Chinese zodiac|Chinese zodiac]].
{{HideSpoiler|
* Fluff is the first known kwami of the Chinese zodiac to be activated and used.
* In &quot;Timetagger&quot;, future Alix is seen feeding Fluff a carrot. This is a point of interest because despite carrots often being affiliated with rabbits, they are actually the rabbit equivalent of junk food. The primary food source for the average rabbit is grass.
*Fluff is the first kwami whose concept doesn't end in an &quot;-ion&quot; word.}}

{{Quote|The first time I saw you in that ad, I told myself, &quot;Wayhem, I got to meet this guy. He's so cool!&quot;. What if I was, like, your biggest fan?|Wayhem to [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]]|&quot;[[Gorizilla]]&quot;|quotelink=yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/974059425362251778&lt;/ref&gt; is a teenager who is a fan of [[Adrien Agreste]].

In &quot;[[Party Crasher]]&quot;, when Wayhem  feels left out for not being allowed to get in the party being held in Adrien's room, he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Party Crasher''', a disco-themed [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Wayhem stands at a medium height, his skin is light tan, and he has dark brown eyes and dark brown wavy hair that he dyed blond to imitate [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]].

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a white button-down shirt with an upturned collar and sleeves rolled up above his elbow, which he keeps unbuttoned. On the upper left side of the shirt, there is a green chameleon logo. Underneath, he wears a black shirt with five horizontal stripes around the chest which are colored, from top to bottom, yellow, olive green, bright green, dark green, and periwinkle (though in &quot;Gorizilla&quot;, these stripes are not seen). He wears blue jeans, a brown belt, and red sneakers with white laces and soles.

=== As Party Crasher ===
Party Crasher wears a stereotypical 70's disco dancer's outfit, with an unbuttoned disco ball patterned shoulder pad jacket and matching pants. He also has a black v-necked dress shirt with a popped collar and a smaller silver disco ball pendant necklace. He wears a pair of sunglasses of the same style as the jacket and pants. At the end of each hand he wields a disco ball shaped gauntlet which he uses to activate his powers. He has blue skin and pink hair styled into an afro, alongside a pink mustache.

== Personality ==
[[File:GZ_(459).png|thumb|left|Wayhem carrying a cardboard cutout of Adrien.]]
Wayhem is overly enthusiastic, courageous, passionate, and sometimes obnoxious. He dedicates himself to anything that he wants, like [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]]'s autograph, although sometimes going too far in his obsessions with his energy and forwardness. He often reacts melodramatically to situations, from panicking for Adrien's safety when he falls from a building to gushing in delight when Adrien gives him his email address. However, when he realizes his mistakes, he feels quite guilty about it. Bold, he takes on any challenge to protect what he cares about, as seen in &quot;[[Gorizilla]]&quot; as he tries to defend Adrien from the [[Adrien's bodyguard|titular villain]]. He also shows quick thinking by spraying Gorizilla with perfume to undermine his enhanced sense of smell.

== Abilities ==
=== As Party Crasher ===
Party Crasher has a large selection of disco-themed powers. Primarily he can trap people and objects inside the tiny mirrors of his disco ball gauntlets whenever he touches them, causing them to disappear and appear frozen on the mirror. It is not known whether this ability is voluntary or not, as everything touched by the gauntlets disappears, even if Party Crasher did not mean to touch it. The people trapped inside the gauntlets appear to be frozen in time to an extent, as they are not seen moving or emoting in any way until they are released, which can be accomplished by breaking the gauntlets. 

Party Crasher also displayed the ability to shoot a sparkling beam of refracted light from his gauntlets, which has the same effect as touching something with the gauntlets. There are no stated limitations on the mirror beams but given that Party Crasher only uses them occasionally, it can be inferred that there is some period of cool down before he can use it again. He is also able to predict the future movements of his opponents, visualizing the area as a disco-tiled floor with his opponents movements projected as static silhouettes on each tile. This ability can be used against multiple people at once, although the user is liable to be overwhelmed by the amount of movement. 

Curiously, Party Crasher is also displayed the ability to shape shift his gauntlets, first transforming them into a helicopter to transport the captured heroes to Hawk Moth, and later reforming them when they had been shattered into pieces by King Monkey; It is not explained why he is able to do this.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Adrien Agreste]] ===
[[File:GZ_(1023).png|thumb|Wayhem apologizes to Adrien.]]
Wayhem is a huge fan of Adrien, dressing like him and admiring him. When he meets Adrien in &quot;Gorizilla&quot;, he is very ecstatic, and he chases Adrien around town with other fans. However, his admiration of Adrien leads him to confront Gorizilla with a bottle of perfume, and he willingly pretends to be Adrien to confuse Gorizilla and — unknowingly — help Adrien run off to transform into Cat Noir. Although giddy around Adrien, he apologizes for posting an image of Adrien that caught people's attention. Excitedly, Wayhem accepts Adrien's friendship while promising not to endanger his obscurity in public again.

== Sightings ==
=== Episodes ===
{{AppearancesS2|GZ=yes|GL=yes}}
{{AppearancesS3|PC=yes|IG=back}}

== Trivia ==
* Wayhem's outfit is very similar to Adrien's outfit.
** [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] briefly mistakes Wayhem for Adrien because of the similarity when she is at [[André Glacier|André's]] ice cream stand in &quot;Glaciator&quot;.
* In &quot;Gorizilla&quot;, on his social media post, his name is spelled as Wayem.
* His name is a play on the word &quot;mayhem&quot;, and in fact his over-enthusiasm did cause some mayhem to Adrien.
* He was the first akumatized villain to successfully get hold of both Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses. However, he failed to deliver them to Hawk Moth because of King Monkey's intervention.

{{Quote|Fly away, my evil/little akuma, and evilize him/her.|[[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]]|}}
An '''akuma''' is a black lepidopteran creature responsible for [[Akumatization|transforming]] people into [[Akumatized villains|supervillains]]. An army of akumas is created and led by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] while [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] are tasked with capturing and purifying them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/Miraculous.Ladybug/photos/a.296331537138512.58163.290735154364817/578155768956086/?type=1 Unofficial Miraculous LadyBug Facebook fanpage]. Retrieved 2015-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
Before it is turned into an akuma by Hawk Moth, the butterfly is pure white and bluish. However, once it becomes an akuma, it turns black with translucent purple highlights.

In &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)]]&quot;, when infused with extra power by Scarlet Moth they're crimson with bright red edges and white markings.

In &quot;Party Crasher&quot;, the butterfly in it's chrysalis form is the same color when it's purified by Ladybug or Hawk Moth and before being turned into an akuma pure white.

== Creation and abilities ==
Hawk Moth creates an akuma by charging a butterfly with his dark energy. The purpose of an akuma is to possess an [[List of akumatized objects|important object]] of a person, forming a telepathic connection between the person and Hawk Moth. Once the deal is made, the akuma in the object releases a black and purple substance that transforms the person into a supervillain. They also can squeeze through impossibly small spaces, even being able to move through the seal of a windowpane.
[[File:OR1-(1090).png|left|thumb|A non-purified akuma duplicating.]]
If an akuma is removed from one's object but goes uncaptured and unpurified, it will duplicate itself exponentially before returning to Hawk Moth and entering his [[cane]]. The copies of the akuma will subsequently fly around and indiscriminately seek out other humans. Any humans that make contact with the akuma clones will turn into exact physical copies of the original host's villain form and be petrified in this state. Should the akuma's former host manage to regain the negative emotions that transformed them, to begin with, the original akuma will leave the cane and return to corrupt them once again, and the aforementioned duplicates will awaken and be under their full control, becoming a massive clone army.

When multiple akumas are in existence, they can form a giant swarm shaped like Hawk Moth's head, which he can speak through.

In &quot;Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)&quot;, when they're infused with extra power they can transform anyone that still has negative emotion will be akumatized into a scarlet version of the previous akumatized villains.

As seen in [[Party Crasher]] the akumas are grown in [[Emilie Agreste]] 's [[Unknown repository]].

== Fate ==
[[File:OR-2 (839).png|thumb|Ladybug releasing a former akuma that was reverted back into a butterfly.]]
The akuma leaves the object it inhabits after it is destroyed. From there, Ladybug can catch it with her [[yo-yo]] in order to &quot;de-evilize&quot; it by removing the dark energy from it. Afterward, once the akuma reverts back to being a normal butterfly, she releases it, and the butterfly is free, possibly returning to the countryside rather than to Hawk Moth's lair.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/thomas_astruc/status/673631408494133248&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims either has little or no memory of the event, or are able to aware that they are being akumatized. However, volunteers like Lila Rossi are exceptions in this case.

In &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)]]&quot;, it shows that Hawk Moth can revert the akuma into a normal butterfly when he remove someone's powers without Ladybug destroying an object or purifying the akuma. As a result, the affected has not shown signs of confusion or fatigue.

If the akuma is released without being purified, it will multiply and infect other people. But when it is defeated and purified, its duplicates will vanish, regressing the original victim and the other people affected back to normal.

== Trivia ==
[[File:The_Chase_(4).png|thumb|The butterfly's chibi design as seen in &quot;[[The Chase]]&quot;.]]
* In Japanese, &quot;akuma&quot; (悪魔) means &quot;demon&quot; or &quot;devil&quot;.
** Akumas are not evil by nature. The black color just means they're charged with power.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/872028028783792129&lt;/ref&gt;
** The word &quot;evilize&quot; was created by [[Thomas Astruc]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/thomas_astruc/status/673993702101094401&lt;/ref&gt;
* In most Asian lore, butterflies symbolize change, however, they are a sign of bad luck when in large numbers.
** In some animistic beliefs, the sight of butterflies or moths approaching or entering one's house means that an unexpected guest or intruder will arrive in the near future.
* Akumas are similar to [[Kwamis|kwamis]], both being able to inhabit an object and transform a person into a super-being.
* Whilst under Hawk Moth's power, they are similar in appearance and function to the [[w:c:bleach:Jigokuchō|Jigokuchō]] from ''Bleach''.
* An akuma will not corrupt someone if they recover from their negative emotions. Examples include:
** In &quot;Stoneheart (Origins - Part 2)&quot;, as Marinette manages to cheer [[Ivan Bruel|Ivan]] up before Hawk Moth akumatizes him again.
** In &quot;Despair Bear&quot;, when Hawk Moth tries to akumatize the guests at Chloé's party before she remedies her behavior.
** In &quot;Gigantitan&quot;, when Hawk Moth tries to akumatize [[Adrien's bodyguard]]. He calms down upon seeing Adrien, which causes his negative emotions to disappear.
** In &quot;Zombizou&quot;, where the akuma was meant for Marinette. Her negative emotions fade away after [[Caline Bustier]] tells her she's not being punished.
* On occasions, an akuma will be attracted to the person whose negative emotions resonate the strongest.
** Seen in &quot;Gigantitan&quot;, when [[August]] got akumatized instead of Adrien's bodyguard.
** Also in &quot;Zombizou&quot;, where the akuma was intended for Marinette but was drawn to Miss Bustier due to her fear being more intense than Marinette's rage.
* [[Mayura (Heroes' Day - Part 2)|Mayura]] is the first episode in which a regular (black and purple) akuma does not make an appearance.
* In &quot;Party Crasher&quot;, it's shown that akumas are produced by butterfly farming from Hawk Moth’s [[Unknown repository|repository]].
** As of this episode an akuma is yet to be seen in it's larvae stage and it's also unknown what they eat when in that stage.
*** Since they grow into white butterflies it could be possible that they start out as white caterpillars.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a superhero in the United States of America and [[Knightowl]]'s partner.

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Sparrow is at a medium height.
=== As Sparrow ===

Sparrow has a dark gray mask covering his face, with the top of the mask being dark brown. Over his mask, he wears goggles with gray straps and circular red lenses. He also wears a brown hooded jacket. The hood is worn over his head, and it's designed after the head of a sparrow, having a dark gray beak, white markings on its forehead and the sides, and an eye with a dark brown pupil. Underneath his jacket, he has a white suit, and over it, he has dark gray buckles around his torso. On his upper left leg, there is a dark brown bag with pockets, and he wears gray gloves.

== Personality ==
Sparrow is witty and supportive. Some instances make him exasperated when others are confused, but he supplies any information they need.

== Abilities ==
Sparrow is physically fit, having enough stamina and skill to keep up with [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] while they're running and to jump from edge to edge down a huge crack in in the ground.

==Relationships==
=== [[Knightowl]] ===
Sparrow and Knightowl are partners, but Sparrow is seen as a sidekick by Knightowl, which he doesn't appreciate much. It is unknown if he is aware of Knightowl's true identity.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] ===
Sparrow gets along okay with Ladybug and Cat Noir, liking their ideas and teasing them. In one case, he facepalms at them when they are confused by [[Camilla Hombee|President Camilla Hombee]] revealing her secret identity. He relates to an unknown degree to their frustration with the way others see them as well. When Knightowl insults Cat Noir, Sparrow tries to cheer him up by pointing he is viewed the same way by Knightowl, but unlike Cat Noir, he &quot;doesn't have a cute partner&quot;. Later, when Knightowl dismisses Ladybug's plan to stop the [[Kenya's father|Trash Krakken]], Sparrow sticks up for her and points out that her plan is far less destructive and more sensible than Knightowl's.

== Trivia ==
* Prior to his debut in ''Miraculous Adventures'', Sparrow was originally part of the first conception of the [[Quantic Kids]], a team of teenage superheroes composed of Ladybug, Cat Noir, [[Mercury]], and [[Melodie]]. Sparrow was replaced with [[Kid Mime]] by producers in a later stage of production. However, the entire concept was ultimately discarded.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/648970732551176197&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Thomas Astruc]] commented on Twitter that Sparrow was his favorite superhero created for Quantic Kids, and he considered Kid Mime to be a weak replacement for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
* In ''Miraculous Adventures'', Cat Noir refers to him as &quot;Birdy.&quot;
** This was later revealed to be either an error or a nickname.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/940087518808096768&lt;/ref&gt;
* In concept art, it appears that Sparrow throws a kind of dart/weapon. The way he held his left arm back and had his index and middle finger positioned is like how archers hold back a bow string.
* Sparrow appears on a comic book cover with Knightowl in &quot;The Dark Owl&quot;.

The '''Pied Piper of Hamelin''' is a figure from folklore in Germany who lived approximately 730 years ago. He was a past [[Miraculous holders|Miraculous holder]], wielding the [[Fox Miraculous]].

If this past Fox Miraculous holder had the same powers as the recent holder ([[Alya Césaire|Alya]]), he had enhanced physical abilities and the superpower [[Mirage]]. He also used the [[flute]].

==Trivia==
*When asked if the Pied Piper of Hamelin was a former Fox Miraculous holder, [[Thomas Astruc]] responded, &quot;Why not?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;

* ''Fuchs'' means fox in German.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a superhero team of [[Miraculous holders]] in [[Paris]], France. Their current purpose is to defeat [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]]'s [[Akumatized villains|akumatized villains]], prevent him from taking the [[Ladybug Miraculous]] and [[Cat Miraculous]], and (possibly) recovering the lost Miraculouses.

== History ==
=== [[Season 1]] ===
[[File:OR1-(430).png|left|thumb|Master Wang Fu sneaking the Cat Miraculous to the Agreste mansion for Adrien.]]
In &quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)|Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]&quot;, when [[Wang Fu|Master Wang Fu]] and [[Wayzz]] figured out that the [[Butterfly Miraculous]] was being used for evil, Fu decided that he would need help in stopping its user. To find suitable users, Fu went into the streets and tested people by pretending to be feeble and needing help. [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] pulled him across the street and out of the way of a rushing vehicle, while [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]] handed him his cane and helped him stand up from the ground, despite the sacrifices both teenagers made to assist him. Afterwards, Wang sneaked the Ladybug Miraculous and Cat Miraculous in tiny chests into their respective rooms.

Adrien and Marinette opened the chests, unleashing the Miraculouses' [[kwamis]]. [[Tikki]] and [[Plagg]] explained their powers, Hawk Moth's akumatization, and the need to save Paris to Marinette and Adrien respectively. Adrien eagerly accepted the responsibility to become Cat Noir, while Marinette reluctantly transformed into Ladybug. The heroes met up while testing their new abilities, and both figured out how to stop [[Ivan Bruel|Stoneheart]], not without some mistakes and complications along the way. Ladybug gained confidence in herself, while Cat Noir became smitten with her. However, Ladybug forgot to purify the [[akuma]], leading it to multiply and transform many people into frozen copies of Stoneheart. Crestfallen, Marinette decided she wasn't meant to be a superhero, taking off the Ladybug earrings.

[[File:OR-2 (1041).png|thumb|The end card of &quot;Stoneheart&quot; with the team.]]
Marinette attempted to give the Ladybug Miraculous to [[Alya Césaire|Alya]] at [[Collège Françoise Dupont|school]] by sneaking it into her [[Alya's bags|bag]] in &quot;[[Stoneheart (Origins - Part 2)|Stoneheart]]&quot;, but she didn't discover it before rushing off to see the [[Akumatization|re-akumatized]] Stoneheart. Trying to get Alya's bag to her, Marinette witnessed Cat Noir being overtaken by the Stoneheart copies and Alya being pinned to a building by a thrown car. Desperate to save them, Marinette put the Ladybug Miraculous on again and transformed into Ladybug. She saved both Alya and Cat Noir, and she took responsibility for failing to stop Stoneheart when she was called out by [[Roger Raincomprix]]. Cat Noir cheered her up by reminding her that she had saved lives, but before more could be accomplished, an image of Hawk Moth appeared, comprised of akumas. Hawk Moth demanded for Ladybug and Cat Noir to give up, but Ladybug argued back about his villainous deeds and the heroes' intention to stop him. With Cat Noir's help, Ladybug purified all of the akumas, saved Ivan and Mylène, and returned Paris back to normal with Miraculous Ladybug. Ladybug and Cat Noir split ways, with the latter admitting he can't wait to see her again soon.

After their origins, the duo continued to fight any civilians that Hawk Moth akumatizes into villains by exploiting the negative emotions caused by specific individuals such as [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]] and even themselves accidentally, along with doing heroic acts outside of fighting like protecting the mayor's daughter. While Cat Noir developed romantic feelings for Ladybug, she only saw him as a friend and a partner, due to her having a crush in her civilian life. Some notable events include the temporary death of Cat Noir in &quot;[[Timebreaker]]&quot;, Marinette almost having conflicts with Cat Noir and finding out about past Ladybug Miraculous holders in &quot;[[The Pharaoh]]&quot; indirectly with Alya's help, and meeting Wang Fu as a healer for Tikki without finding out his role with the [[Miraculouses]] in &quot;[[Princess Fragrance]]&quot;. During &quot;[[Lady Wifi]]&quot; and &quot;[[Simon Says]]&quot; there had been heavy suspicions about their secret identities along with almost losing their Miraculouses, but the team managed to conquer these events.[[File:VP (1132).png|thumb|left|Marinette officially met Master Wang Fu in &quot;Volpina&quot;.]]

Things began to change for the team in &quot;[[Volpina]]&quot; when Adrien unknowingly found the [[Miraculous spellbook]] in a safe in his [[Gabriel Agreste|father]]'s [[Gabriel's atelier|atelier]] with Plagg's help. He took the book from the safe, and the book eventually was eventually stolen by Marinette and Tikki for the latter's concern. Taking the book to Wang Fu's [[Fu's massage shop|massage]] [[Fu's massage shop|shop]], Marinette officially met Master Wang Fu, the last guardian of the Miraculouses.

=== [[Season 2]] ===
In &quot;[[The Collector]]&quot;, Marinette and Fu concluded that whoever was in possession of the book had to be Hawk Moth as it was stolen along with the [[Butterfly Miraculous|Butterfly]] and [[Peacock Miraculous|Peacock]] Miraculouses during the destruction of the [[Guardians' temple|temple]] of the [[Order of the Guardians]].
[[File:TC_(145).png|thumb|Wang Fu looking at the Miraculous spellbook with Marinette.]]
After wondering if it was Adrien, Marinette suspected Gabriel was the true culprit as he's an eccentric artist who never leaves his home and after learning that he owned the book. However, Gabriel threw them off by akumatizing himself, which the heroes and Wang didn't know was possible. Once she and Cat Noir defeated Gabriel's akumatized form, Marinette returned to book to Gabriel after Wang took pictures of it with his phone in order to rescind Adrien from his grounding. Like the rest of the previous holders, Marinette received a [[kwagatama]] from Tikki on her birthday in &quot;[[Befana]]&quot;, symbolizing their friendship. Sometime afterwards, as mentioned in &quot;[[Sapotis]]&quot;, Wang Fu teaches Marinette about the other Miraculouses and everything he learned from the spellbook.

In &quot;[[Robostus]]&quot;, Ladybug and Cat Noir heard [[Markov|Robostus]] declare that he wanted their Miraculouses to grant his wish of [[File:Robostus_-_Ending_Card.png|thumb|left|Knowing of Ultimate Power]]being human, and they later realized that the ability to make a wish is also what Hawk Moth wants. Later, Marinette asked Wang Fu about it, who explained that the Ladybug Miraculous and Cat Miraculous together (along with a using a special invocation) can grant a person's wish and alter reality. However, in order to keep the universe in balance, there is a price to pay for each wish; for example, if Robostus had wished to be human, someone else would've lost their humanity in turn. With the new knowledge, Marinette determinedly vowed to keep her Miraculous and Cat Noir's Miraculous from ending up in anyone's hands, including Hawk Moth's.

During &quot;[[The Dark Owl]]&quot;, both heroes continued their duties outside of combat, such as helping the hero fan, Mr. Damocles from falling from a tree. However, in an attempt to make his dream come true Mr. Damocles was eventually akumatized into Dark Owl after he got humiliated. As Dark Owl, he trapped Ladybug and Cat Noir in order to force them to hand over their Miraculouses. Ladybug tricked him by apparently giving their jewels, and as part of this plan, Ladybug and Cat Noir de-transformed while keeping their eyes closed. Tikki and Plagg discovered each other's partner's secret identity, but they kept quiet on their new knowledge.

Sometime later, during &quot;[[Glaciator]]&quot;, both Marinette and Cat Noir both admit to each other that they have relationship problems. When the two heroes meet again, this time with Marinette as Ladybug, Cat Noir treated her coldly but later forgave her afterwards. Once the mission was over, Ladybug said that she was in love with someone else but she considered him a close friend and a partner. As for Marinette, she discovers that the hero's feelings for her alter ego is very real and yet they remain hopeful of each other's love.

[[File:Sapotis-001059.png|thumb|The end card of &quot;Sapotis&quot; with their newest ally, Rena Rouge.]]
When Ladybug and Cat Noir faced [[Ella and Etta Césaire|Sapotis]], duplicating akumatized villains which caused chaos throughout Paris and were too many for the two heroes to defeat alone, Ladybug gets the idea from her [[Lucky Charm]] [[List of Lucky Charm objects|object]], a teapot, to seek Wang Fu for help. When Wang realizes that she and Cat Noir need the help of another Miraculous holder to succeed, albeit reluctant about any Miraculouses being taken out in fear of a Miraculous falling into the wrong hands. He gave Marinette permission to choose a Miraculous, giving it to a trustworthy person, and have the person return it to her after the villain's defeat. After careful consideration, Marinette takes the [[Fox Miraculous]], and as Ladybug, gives it to [[Alya Césaire|Alya]] while making her promise to hand it back to her afterwards. Alya transforms into [[Rena Rouge]], and with her assistance and quick-thinking despite being new at the job, the heroes stopped Sapotis. Although she is initially reluctant to give up the the Fox Miraculous, Alya returns it to Ladybug. Marinette returns the Miraculous to Wang, who congratulates her for making a wise choice. Meanwhile, Hawk Moth figures out that a guardian has to be in Paris like he predicted because of the Fox Miraculous' appearance.

Unbeknownst to Adrien, by studying Cat Noir's picture, Gabriel believes that his son is Cat Noir in &quot;[[Gorizilla]]&quot; and even akumatizes Adrien's bodyguard to investigate. By having Wayhem, a fan, act as his double, Adrien was able to fool him and keep his identity safe.

In &quot;[[Frightningale]]&quot; and &quot;[[Troublemaker]]&quot;, Marinette faced a similar problem when she accepted Clara's offer to play to her alter ego in Clara's video almost revealing herself until Chloé cancelled the shoot and when Troublemaker took one of Ladybug's earrings almost revealing herself to Cat Noir until she retrieved her earring.

[[File:Syren_-_Ending_Card.png|left|thumb|Ladybug, Cat Noir and their kwamis in their new Aqua Powers]]
During the events of &quot;[[Syren]]&quot;, Cat Noir and Ladybug were able to use the other transformation abilities of their kwamis through the Miraculous spellbook to access ''Aqua Mode'' for the first time. Cat Noir also struggled with Ladybug who was hiding secrets from him, but after Adrien and Wang Fu officially meet he thanks her for keeping her promise. Gabriel also became more determined to find the guardian.

[[File:Carapace_Transformation_(41).png|thumb|The team's new ally Carapace]]
In &quot;[[Anansi]]&quot;, as Ladybug and Cat Noir fought against [[Nora Césaire|Anansi]], a spider supervillain who kidnapped Alya but found out they she was too strong for them to handle alone with help from Ladybug's Lucky Charm object, which is a candle. She sought to seek Master Fu for help while Nino held off Anansi. Arriving at his shop, Marinette explained the situation as before he allowed Marinette to pick a Miraculous along with a trusted ally. Knowing they needed the help of a protective one, she chose Master Wang's [[Turtle Miraculous]] and knows of the right person to give it to. As Ladybug, she gives it to [[Nino Lahiffe|Nino]] under the condition that it must be returned after Anansi's defeat. After Nino transforms into Carapace, with his [[Shell-ter]] power the trio was able to save Alya and defeat Anansi. After the mission, Nino returned the Turtle Miraculous to Ladybug and she returned it to Master Wang. However, Hawk Moth notices that the heroes are increasing in allies but has something more sinister planned for them.

In &quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;, The kwamis in the Miracle Box attempt to contact Nooroo on his birthday, but instead contact Hawk Moth, so now he knows the existence of the other kwamis and seeks to enslave them all. More information about the kwamis is revealed. For example, the active kwamis bring gifts of all kinds from their owner's home to share with the inactive kwamis, and that all kwamis are put under a magic spell that prevent them from saying their wielder's real names to other kwamis.

During Fashion Week in &quot;[[Style Queen (Queen's Battle - Part 1)|Style Queen]]&quot;, Chloé's mom [[Audrey Bourgeois]] makes an appearance for the show meanwhile Gabriel Agreste is below his mansion talking to someone which is revealed to be his wife who has an unspecified condition, and is the reason Gabriel wants the Miraculouses in the first place. As the show started, Audrey was akumatized into Style Queen, Hawk Moth's masterpiece. To make matters worse Adrien becomes the villainess' first victim, leaving Ladybug to fight on her own. When she tells Master Fu what happened, Marinette is greeted by Plagg, who has already told Master Fu what happened.

Plagg offered to help her, but Master Fu said it was out of the question and allowed Marinette to pick a Miraculous, along with a trusted ally. Returning to the Eiffel Tower Ladybug finds Alya and offers her the Bee Miraculous, but was attacked before she could use it. Ladybug was on her own and cornered until Plagg arrived and saved her with Cataclysm, (which reveals that kwamis can use their owner's abilities) leading to Style Queen's defeat and Hawk Moth losing hope. Meanwhile back at the fashion show, Tikki reminded Marinette of the [[Bee Miraculous]] and realized it's missing, but unbeknownst to her it is found by Chloé who opens it and is greeted by [[Pollen]].

During the events of &quot;[[Queen Wasp (Queen's Battle - Part 2)|Queen Wasp]]&quot;, Gabriel loses hope to the point where he relinquishes Nooroo and appears at the fashion show to embrace his son. As the show closed Gabriel and Adrien commended Marinette for derby hat design which impressed Audrey that she gave her the opportunity to come to New York. But Chloé was so angry and desperate to prove herself to her mother she unveils the Bee Miraculous and transforms into Queen Bee in front of everyone. Continuing to do so Chloé creates a fake emergency by using her powers to cause a speeding train. After being saved by the duo Ladybug demanded that she return the jewel but things get worse when Hawk Moth is renewed with hope and akumatizes her. The duo was able to deakumatize Chloé, now calm, they told her that the Bee Miraculous must be returned but she begged them for another chance. That's when they explained that everyone makes mistakes and it's important to fix them with that in mind Chloé returned the jewel and apologized to her idols. Meanwhile Marinette turns down Audrey's offer deciding to stay with her friends and family and helps Chloé make things up with her mother.

In &quot;[[Malediktator]]&quot;, after everyone tells Chloé off about not being a hero she gets so angry and leaves for New York. But when André becomes akumatized into Malediktator a commanding supervillain, Chloé begins to realize her mistake and to make matters worse Cat Noir falls under the villain's control. Knowing she needed help Ladybug sought out Master Fu and chose the Bee Miraculous again this time knowing how to use it. After finding Chloé the heroine helped her come clean with her mistake and encouraged her to fix it now accepting full responsibility Chloé was given the Bee Miraculous. As Queen Bee, Chloé followed Ladybug's lead with her Venom power and Cat Noir's help they were able to stop Malediktator and save the city. This time not disobeying her idols, Chloé returned the Bee Miraculous willingly earning her teammate's recognition.

Ladybug and Cat Noir continued their duties outside of combat in &quot;[[Frozer]]&quot;. However, they began to question their relationship, thinking they can only be just friends and nothing more, and seek help from Luka and Kagami. When dealing with Frozer in their new ''Ice Mode'', the two went their separate ways but realized they work best as a team bringing their ideas together.

On Heroes' Day in &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)|Catalyst]]&quot;, Hawk Moth commences his biggest plan yet through the help of Volpina he makes everyone vulnerable to akumatizion and by turning Nathalie into Catalyst to amplify his powers Hawk Moth becomes Scarlet Moth. Using his increased powers, he reakumatized almost all the villains the heroes had ever faced, creating an army. Meanwhile Cat Noir and Ladybug summoned their allies to fight him.

[[File:MA (587).png|thumb|The end card of &quot;Mayura&quot; with all of their new allies, Rena Rouge, Queen Bee and Carapace.]]
In the second part of the season finale, despite Rena Rouge's, Carapace's, and Queen Bee's best efforts, they were akumatized into scarlet versions of themselves and turned against Ladybug and Cat Noir. But with help from the people of Paris the duo was able to hold them off and square off against Scarlet Moth. By destroying his cane, they were able to deakumatize everyone, including their allies. Backing their archenemy into a corner they were about to take his Miraculous until a new Miraculous wielder named Mayura entered the scene, leading to Hawk Moth escaping and the heroes suspecting he has the [[Peacock Miraculous]] wielder by his side. Nonetheless, the team rebels in their victory but knows the fight isn't over.



=== [[Season 3]] ===
The duo continues their fight against Hawk Moth, however Lila makes her return and tries to win Adrien's affections as well at war with Marinette. In &quot;Weredad&quot;, when Marinette believes that Cat Noir was going to discover her identity as Ladybug. She tells the hero she loves him however, during a brunch date he tells Marinette that he has feelings for Ladybug. With that Marinette was very happy but her convincing act lead to her father Tom's akumatization after a sky high battle, Cat Noir explains that he thought Marinette was one of his fans. When she accepts the hero's feelings for Ladybug they continue being friends.

And yet, little by little Gabriel gains more clues to finding the guardian in &quot;Backwarder&quot; when he akumatizes Master Fu's friend [[Marianne Lenoir]]. He learns that the guardian has been hiding under a false name, though he doesn’t know what it is.

And yet, in a few episodes like &quot;[[Animaestro]]&quot;, &quot;[[Oblivio]]&quot;, and others, things take an interesting turn in the ways of love for the heroes, Chloé figures out that Marinette has a crush on Adrien.

[[File:Oblivio_-_Infobox_Image.png|thumb|left|Ladybug and Cat Noir kiss.]]Against Oblivio the duo had their memories erased and since they used their powers before they got struck the pair discover each other's identity. Despite their amnesic states Marinette, Adrien and Tikki (albeit he and Tikki meet for the first time) manage to keep out of the villain's sight and restore their powers. In doing so they believe that they are more than just a team and consider each other a couple starting to develop feelings for the other. However with Oblivio's defeat they discover that Ladybug's other superpower will put things back to the way they were including their memories. Realizing that they'll forget being in love they share a kiss but the moment doesn't go unnoticed by Alya who took a picture after being deakumatized with Nino.

With their memories restored and upon seeing the picture Marinette becomes shocked that she kissed Cat Noir while Adrien remains hopeful of his love with Ladybug and yet Hawk Moth has also discovered about their love for each other.

During &quot;Silencer&quot;, Marinette discovers that Luka has developed feelings for her. And like him Kagami has developed feelings for Adrien in &quot;Oni-Chan&quot;. But unknown to Ladybug and Cat Noir, that while seeing Lila's actions Hawk Moth as Gabriel struck an alliance seeing her as an good ally.

Rena Rouge, Carapace, and Queen Bee continue to help Ladybug and Cat Noir fight against Hawk Moth and Mayura in &quot;Miraculer&quot;. Aware that their enemies know Chloé’s identity Ladybug has been hesitant on giving the Bee Miraculous to her out of fear of her and her loved ones being in danger. However, Hawk Moth and Mayura know this and use this to their advantage, using Lila Rossi's manipulation. After Miraculer's defeat, Ladybug finally explains to Chloé as to why she's been inactive recently. Chloé, albeit slowly, comes to an understanding and returns the jewel, but remains hopeful they'll call on her again. However, she stops worshiping Ladybug and views her as any other person. Hawk Moth also remains hopeful that they would get Chloé on their side someday.

By the time of &quot;[[Party Crasher]]&quot;, Ladybug and Cat Noir's team is revealed to have grown with Luka and Max becoming their new teammates as Viperion and Pegasus respectively. In this episode, after the other superheroes were captured by the titular villain, Kim is chosen by Master Fu to become the holder of the Monkey Miraculous, known as King Monkey.

During Adrien's trip to the Musée Grévin wax museum with his friends in &quot;[[The Puppeteer 2]]&quot;, he received a mixed up message from Nino; thinking that Marinette hated him. Meanwhile Marinette had trouble keeping her cool when Alya left her alone, not wanting to lose her friendship Adrien tried to find a way to make her more comfortable but he froze. When he heard her say all those things about him, Adrien unfroze but upset Marinette and apologized. Then asked if she was for real about what she said but retorted saying she wasn't. Afterwards, having a moment alone they apologized for what happened and continued to be friends but Marinette was downhearted when Adrien admits that he had a crush on another girl but was encouraged by Tikki not to give up on him.

{{SpoilerButton}}
{{HideSpoiler|During &quot;Stormy Weather 2&quot;, everyone laments on how much they've change through the powers of the Miraculous jewels and their feelings too.

During &quot;Timetagger&quot;, it's revealed that in the future Ladybug and Cat Noir are still fighting akumatized villains who are now controlled by a new Butterfly Miraculous holder. It's also revealed they had assemble a superhero team that includes a future Alix Kubdel who holds the [[Rabbit Miraculous]], using it to turn into Bunnyx.

During the fight against the titular villain in &quot;[[Ikari Gozen]]&quot;, Ladybug temporarily lends the [[Dragon Miraculous]] to [[Kagami Tsurugi]] when she is taken prisoner by her akumatized mother. With it, Kagami becomes Ryuko and uses her power over certain elements to help Ladybug and Cat Noir defeat Ikari Gozen. However, because Hawk Moth got to know her civilian identity when she was freed, Ladybug, after having the Dragon Miraculous returned from Kagami, tells her she won't be able to give her back the Miraculous because of the risk of putting her love ones in danger. As Marinette and Kagami spend Friendship Day together, she starts to see another side to her due to her mother's strict upbringing Kagami doesn't have any friends but has a strong desire to make them. Despite losing the contest the two have a better understanding of each other.

&quot;[[Reflekdoll]]&quot; and the rest of season's 3 episodes held many surprises for the heroes starting for the first time they not only had to fight against Hawk Moth's akumatized villain Reflekta but also a sentimonster created by his ally Mayura. However, that wasn't their only problem due to the destruction caused by Reflekdoll it led to Ladybug and Cat Noir's jewels becoming swapped. Despite walking a mile in each other's shoes as Lady Noir and Mister Bug they defeated them(unknown that Peacock Miraculous was damaged). Thanks to the experience Ladybug and Cat Noir have a better understanding of each other.

In &quot;[[Desperada]]&quot;, two heroes come to the rescue for the price of one seeing the titular villain as a formidable opponent the Snake Miraculous' power of Second Chance was needed. However, due to Marinette having a &quot;troubled heart&quot;, as Ladybug she picked Adrien to wield the jewel and due to him wanting to impress his crush as Aspik, it led to the heroine being captured several times over until he couldn't bare it anymore. Relinquishing the Snake Miraculous, Adrien informed her of what's been happening for the past few months. When Ladybug had no idea who else could use the Snake Miraculous that's when Adrien recommended Luka, with him becoming the cool, calm and focused Viperion. By observing Desperada and using the power of Second Chance to save his allies, the duo followed his lead in defeating her. Even though, Adrien didn't make a good impression as Aspik he decided to stick with what he's good at being Ladybug's partner as Cat Noir. As for Marinette, one day she'd have to choose between which boy she truly loved.}}

=== ''[[Miraculous Adventures]]'' ===
At an unknown time after the events of &quot;The Collector&quot;, in the [[Miraculous Adventures Issue 2|second issue]], Wang Fu explained the origins of the kwamis and the Miraculouses to Marinette. Later that day, she and Cat Noir were summoned to [[New York City]] through a portal by [[Doorman]]. As detailed in the [[Miraculous Adventures Issue 3|third issue]], [[Uncanny Valley|various superheroes]] requested their help in fighting a huge threat, the [[Kenya's father|Trash Krakken]]. While reluctant with their leader [[Victory]]'s plan, which involved catastrophic destruction followed by the Miraculous Ladybug fixing all of the damage, Ladybug and Cat Noir agreed to help. However, theorizing that a stuffed animal called [[Mr. Squid]] could be related to the monster, Ladybug decided to directly face the monster against orders, Cat Noir loyally following her. [[Knightowl]], [[Sparrow]], and [[Majestia]], with persuasion, were willing to temporarily try the plan to snatch Mr. Squid from the Trash Krakken's body in the [[Miraculous Adventures Issue 4|fourth issue]]. While Sparrow was caught in the Trash Krakken's body, Ladybug, Cat Noir, and Knightowl successfully took the toy. The Trash Krakken reverted back into a human man, and the toy was purified with Ladybug's yo-yo. With New York City saved, the duo and the other superheroes confirmed their alliance, and the duo returned to Paris through another portal.


== System ==
Whenever they realize there are villain attacks happening, Marinette and Adrien transform with their kwamis and Miraculouses into their superhero personas. Both have enhanced physical abilities, such as strength, durability, and agility. While both are skilled fighters in their own rights, they have their unique knowledge and skills: Ladybug is very clever and quick at thinking up plans, able to figure out how to use her [[Lucky Charm]] [[List of Lucky Charm objects|object]] to benefit her situation. For his part, Cat Noir is skilled in fencing and understanding various languages, along with having calm observations and reactions in serious situations. Ladybug is the only hero able to purify akumas, but outside of occasions where Ladybug or Cat Noir have to battle villains on their own, they usually work best as a team by utilizing their strengths together.

After Wang Fu translates some of the spellbook, Ladybug and Cat Noir gain new superpowers related to particular situations, like ice-skating and underwater modes in dealing with particular villains.

For times where they need more support and assistance for defeating a villain, they have part-time superhero team members. One of them is Rena Rouge, who proved to have remarkable resourcefulness and cunning thinking. Then there is Carapace, who proved to have considerably combat skills and exceptional bravery. Another one is Queen Bee, who isn't impressed by people in power and, despite her obnoxious personality, has proven that she can be a very good teammate. Viperion who gives his teammates another chance, Pegasus who is fast and King Monkey who is a quick learner and brave.

{{HideSpoiler|Ryuko who has power over the elements and is an amazing sword fighter. In the future the heroes will also receive help from Bunnyx, a hero whose Miraculous power is to travel through time. She is called as a last resort, when all the other superheroes of the team fail to defeat the villain, as meddling with time is dangerous.}}


== Secret identities ==
The two main members of the team, Ladybug and Cat Noir, decided from the outset, by mutual agreement, to keep their respective civilian identities secret, even from each other.
Even the temporary Miraculous heroes they call for help try to respect this rule, with only Ladybug and (usually) Cat Noir as the only ones who know their secret identities.
However, there have been a few exceptions:
* Queen Bee, aka Chloé Bourgeois, is the only hero whose civilian identity is in the public domain, having transformed in front of the cameras to show everyone (but specifically her mother) her value. Despite the recklessness of her actions, Ladybug, who was in a desperate moment and despite understandable doubts, chose to give her a second chance, and since then Queen Bee has helped the team for some important missions, only to be recently suspended by Ladybug due to her public civilian identity.
* Rena Rouge and Carapace, aka Alya Césaire and Nino Lahiffe, know each other's secret identities. While at first Alya had suspicions about Nino, the latter had no suspicion about the former, but in the Heroes' Day, Ladybug, who was in an emergency situation and didn't have a good justification in mind to separate the couple, was forced to ask both temporary heroes on the spot for help, revealing to each other the other's secret identity. Since then, she has made the two heroes swear to not reveal each other's civilian identities to anyone.
*In &quot;Party Crasher&quot;, Wang loans the Snake Miraculous to Luka, the Horse Miraculous to Max, the Monkey Miraculous to Kim and his Miraculous to Nino. As of yet, besides knowing Kim's identity; it unknown how Wang knew of Max's and Luka's with it being possible that he chose them himself, Marinette or Adrien chose them and either one told him of their identities. It is also possible that Nino, Luka, Max and Wang met before the events of &quot;Party Crasher&quot;.
*{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;Ikari Gozen&quot;, Hawk Moth gets to know that Kagami is Ryuko after she is able to free herself from her akumatized mother's prison. Because of that, Ladybug tells her she may not give her back the Miraculous as it may put Kagami's loved ones in danger.}}
*{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;Desperada&quot;, after a failed attempt to woo Ladybug with the Snake Miraculous, Adrien suggests that Luka wield it. He is thus aware of Luka's identity as Viperion, but cannot acknowledge it in his Cat Noir identity.}}

Ladybug, who is usually the one who recruits new heroes, knows all their civilian identities. Instead, while Cat Noir knows for sure the civilian identities of Queen Bee, Bunnyx, Ryuko, and Viperion and even though several important information has been revealed to him after having officially met Master Fu, it's still ambiguous if he knows the secret identities of Rena Rouge, Carapace, Pegasus and King Monkey since Ladybug often sends him to re-recruit Queen Bee, who does not have a secret identity.

* [[Nathalie Sancoeur|Mayura]] — Hawk Moth's ally, and despite never actually encountering the team in any way (until &quot;[[Miraculer]]&quot;), her actions prevented them from bringing Hawk Moth to justice, revealing her existence to the team.
* [[Kenya's father|Trash Krakken]] — A monster that causes chaos in New York City. Ladybug and Cat Noir team up with other superheroes to stop him, eventually discover that he actually is an ordinary man mysteriously transformed in a similar fashion to akumatization which is still unknown.

=== Civilians ===
* [[Lila Rossi]] — A teenage girl and an Italian exchange student. She despises Ladybug after she exposed her lies to Adrien, who she tried to impress. After she is de-akumatized from being Volpina, Lila refuses accept Ladybug's apology and declares that they will never be friends; she later willingly allows Hawk Moth to akumatize her in order to get her revenge.

== Trivia ==
* In early development, Ladybug and Cat Noir were going to be in a team with other types of superheroes called the [[Quantic Kids]]. However, the concept was scrapped, and Ladybug and Cat Noir were kept as a duo.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoXav4p8zJ4&amp;lc=z124w3x4lnyvxzdrw04chzywfoqvjxsqohw&lt;/ref&gt;
** However, Ladybug and Cat Noir work with the canon version of a character from the Quantic Kids, Sparrow, alongside other heroes in ''Miraculous Adventures''
* The Ladybug Miraculous and Cat Miraculous are the most powerful Miraculouses while being opposites of each other, the former having the power of creation and the latter having the power of destruction. They also compliment each other though, forming something much more powerful.
* According to Victory, Ladybug and Cat Noir are the first superheroes that Paris has had in a long time.
** With that it could be possible that she's talking about [[Jeanne d'Arc]] and [[La Coccinelle]] since they were the first of Paris' superheroes that came before Ladybug and Cat Noir after hearing of them from history.
** Or she could have heard of them from Alya's Ladyblog.
* Various people have done things to show recognition and appreciation towards Ladybug and Cat Noir:
** A statue of Ladybug and Cat Noir, designed by Théo Barbot, is put into the [[Park]] and revealed in a ceremony in &quot;[[Copycat]].&quot;
** [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg|Nathaniel]] draws a comic book in his sketchbook about Ladybug in &quot;[[The Evillustrator]].&quot;
** In &quot;[[Pixelator]],&quot; at his concert, [[Jagged Stone]] dedicates a song to Ladybug, noting her as the girl who saved his life.
** In &quot;[[Lady Wifi]]&quot; and &quot;[[Antibug]],&quot; Chloé cosplays as Ladybug with Sabrina as Cat Noir.
** Life-sized cardboard stand-ups of Ladybug and Cat Noir are used with a donation box in the Tom &amp; Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie in &quot;[[Santa Claws]]&quot;.
** In &quot;[[Prime Queen]]&quot;, Nadja notes on ''[[Side by Side|Face to Face]]'' that many people believe that Ladybug and Cat Noir are a romantic couple. On a later episode of Nadja's series, Alya clarifies for everyone that they aren't together &quot;yet.&quot;
** [[Mr. Damocles]] is inspired by Ladybug, Cat Noir, and Knightowl to become a superhero himself as The Owl in &quot;[[The Dark Owl]]&quot;.
** Alya keeps action figures of Ladybug and Cat Noir in her room as shown in &quot;The Dark Owl&quot;.
** [[Clara Nightingale]] is inspired by Ladybug and Cat Noir to make her hit song Miraculous in &quot;[[Frightningale]]&quot;.
** Adrien also keeps a pair of Ladybug and Cat Noir action figures in &quot;Syren&quot;.
** In &quot;[[Reverser]]&quot;, Marc writes stories about Ladybug.
** During the &quot;Heroes' Day&quot; finale, the people of Paris include parade floats of the heroes.
** In &quot;[[Animaestro]]&quot;, Thomas Astruc creates a movie about Cat Noir and Ladybug.
** In &quot;[[Gamer 2.0]]&quot;, Manon has Cat Noir and Ladybug toy dolls.
** In &quot;[[The Puppeteer 2]]&quot;, the Musée Grévin wax museum has wax statues of Ladybug and Cat Noir.
* Ladybug in &quot;Chameleon&quot; and Queen Bee in &quot;Miraculer&quot;, were the first two team members to resist being akumatized.
** Unlike Chloe, Marinette drove the akuma off before it affected an object of hers while Chloe did it after.
* Cat Noir holds the record for being affected by an akumatized villain with a total of eighteen times.  
{{HideSpoiler|
* As of &quot;[[Cat Blanc]]&quot;, Ladybug is the only member of the team who hasn't been akumatized.
* Out of all the team members Ladybug, King Monkey and Ryuko are the only ones related to their Miraculous predecessors origin wise.
* Ryuko is the only member who isn't native to France.
** She is the second member to have her identity revealed to Hawk Moth following Chloe.
* Cat Noir, Ryuko and Viperion are the only ones whose eyes change upon transforming.}}

{{Quote|The boy I'm crushing on is you, Kim.|Ondine|&quot;[[Syren]]&quot;|quotelink = yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a swimming student. In &quot;[[Syren]]&quot;, after [[Lê Chiến Kim|Kim]] ignores her, she is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Syren''', a mermaid supervillain.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTimes&quot;&gt;http://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/e/gf9msf/miraculous-tales-of-ladybug--cat-noir--s2-e14-syren/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Ondine has tan skin, short red hair, light teal eyes, and several freckles on her face and body.

=== Civilian attire ===
The only costume shown from her is a red-and-black swimsuit, black swimming goggles with dark blue lenses, and a black swimming cap.

=== As Syren ===
As Syren, she has dark pink skin, black freckles on her shoulders and elbows, and a lighter pink face with smaller dark freckles. She has short light red hair, and two silver circular horns sticking out of the top of her head. Her eyes have pinkish-red irises and icy blue sclerae. Her black strapless outfit has a fish-scaly look and a light pink lining. Her feet connect together to make a two-pointed pink fin.

== Personality ==
[[File:Syren_(140).png|thumb|Ondine is disappointed when Kim fails to pick up on her feelings for him.]]Ondine is a sweet and fun girl who enjoys playing games and swimming. She stays cheerful for the most part, although she can become incredibly upset and distressed when faced with huge disappointment, like Kim unintentionally ignoring her attempts to go out with him and showing interest in Chloé instead. She has a huge crush on Kim, even though he does not realize this for the most part, and is shown being overjoyed when Kim asks her to go out to the movies with him.

As Syren, her love for Kim becomes very possessive and obsessive, and she is determined to make him her prince. If anyone threatens her relationship with Kim, such as [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] or [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]], she is easily provoked into attacking them. She is completely indifferent to the effects her actions have on others, never once considering the citizens trapped or hurt because of her flooding of Paris.

== Abilities ==
===As a civilian ===
Ondine is an excellent swimmer.

===As Syren===
Syren has the power to flood all of Paris with her tears and turn it into her own personal domain. She is able to swim incredibly fast and breathe underwater and is also able to blow bubbles filled with air, allowing others to breathe underwater. She says a kiss from her will turn Kim into a merman, allowing him to breathe and live underwater without a bubble, although we never see her utilise this ability. 

==Relationships==
===[[Lê Chiến Kim]]===

[[File:Syren_(104).png|thumb|Ondine decides to tell Kim her feelings.]]Ondine shows romantic interest in Kim in &quot;Syren&quot;, but he is oblivious to her feelings. When akumatized into Syren, she plans to make Paris an underwater kingdom for the two of them. She has apparently tried to confess to him many times before but has never been successful. He does realize her feelings for him when she is akumatized, and at the end of the episode, he asks her to go to the movies with him, much to her joy.

===[[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]]===
[[File:Syren_(18).png|thumb|left|Ondine observes Ladybug, Cat Noir, and Rena Rouge on top of the pool building roof ]]
Ondine has not explicitly talked about them, but when she sees them jumping above the pool as they work to gather some escaped animals, she doesn't appear to be scared. In &quot;Frightningale&quot;, she appears in [[Clara Nightingale]]'s music video wearing a Ladybug mask, implying she likes Ladybug to some extent.

As Syren, she despises Ladybug as the latter tries to set Kim free multiple times. She has no problem attacking her and Cat Noir brutally to get her way.

== Sightings ==

=== Episodes ===
{{AppearancesS2|SY = yes|FN = p|MA = yes}}
{{AppearancesS3|GM2=m}}

== Trivia ==
* Her akumatized form was first revealed in a promotional video for Season 2 from TFOU.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://pandasuite.com/viewer/2.0.2/59a6c26e48abe6f53a002dc9?t=1 (direct video source [https://data.pandasuite.com/videos/59a3e7def643f27d7300131b-universal_1024_1024_20_main_3-0.mp4 here])&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scarlet Syren reappears in the two-part special event &quot;[[Heroes' Day]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
*Her name and her akumatized form might be a reference to an Undine, a species of water elementals or water nymphs.
**Also, Ondine is the name of a girl from the film ''Ondine'' in 2009. Her role in the film was a mermaid who accidentally got caught in the nets of a fishing boat and got brought to land.

{{Quote|You're not a traditional granddaughter, Marinette. And you know what? I like it. |Rolland Dupain|&quot;[[Bakerix]]&quot;}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the paternal grandfather of [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]]. In &quot;[[Bakerix]]&quot;, when Rolland refuses to eat Marinette's bread after finding out she's his granddaughter, he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and becomes '''Bakerix''', a bread-themed [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].&lt;ref&gt;RTS Deux released a list of all the information of the Season 3 episodes on their [https://bit.ly/2TraPvu website] which can also be found [https://bit.ly/2D86whR here] and [https://bit.ly/2S4Nu6e here]. The individual images of the list can also be found [[:File:MLBS3 EP List - RTSDEUX.png|here]]. [[Feri González]] also corroborated the authenticity of the list [https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/1091484996383227905 here].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Rolland is a short man with a large build. He has gray hair, a balding head, bushy gray eyebrows and green eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
Rolland wears a blue and white striped shirt with 5 white buttons, light blue shorts, thick black glasses and dark blue shoes.

=== As Bakerix ===
Bakerix looks like a Gaul made out of bread.

== Personality ==
Rolland is a highly traditional man who enjoys doing things the old-fashioned way. He is very proud of his Gallic heritage and fond of reminiscing over the old days; though, in turn, he is not fond of modern technology or anything he considers non-traditional, being quick to point out when something is not being done the way he thinks it should be done. His fixation with sticking to tradition extends to the point where he isolates himself from the rest of the modern world and even cut ties with his son [[Tom Dupain|Tom]] over him and [[Sabine Cheng|his wife]] changing his bread recipe with rice flour. 

However, despite this, he can be nice and polite towards others, showing kindness to his flour delivery man and later his granddaughter Marinette when she pretends to be a flour delivery intern named Germaine in order to get into his house. Regardless of his aversion to non-traditional things, he is willing to rely on them under certain circumstances, allowing [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] to rush him back home when he fears his bread or granddaughter could be in danger. Furthermore, after realizing that his son's way of baking bread is just as good as his own, he quickly becomes more accepting of going against tradition and decides to reconnect with his family afterwards.    

As Bakerix, he is obsessed with making Paris the way it was when he was young, destroying anything that he considers modern. 

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Like his family, Rolland is an excellent baker.

=== As Bakerix ===
Bakerix wields an elixir that, when drunk, enables him to grow bigger and stronger for a short period of time.

== Family ==
{{Dupain-Cheng Tree}}

== Sightings ==
=== Episodes ===
{{AppearancesS3|BX=yes|GM2=yes|PC=yes}}

== Trivia ==
* Rolland was revealed during a ''Miraculous'' panel at Ludicomix on April 21, 2018. And according to [[Thomas Astruc]], the story of this character will have some elements of his family's story.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludicomix&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousINTL/status/987736701954068481&lt;/ref&gt;
* During a Q &amp; A on January 15 2019, [[Jeremy Zag]] confirmed we would see Marinette's grandfather and more of her family members.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousINTL/status/1085274464630247424&lt;/ref&gt;
* In &quot;Bakerix&quot;, Rolland is the fourth akumatized character to be related to Marinette, after [[Wang Cheng]] in &quot;Kung Food&quot;, [[Gina Dupain]] in &quot;Befana&quot;, and Tom Dupain in &quot;Weredad&quot;.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the [[Kwamis|kwami]] of '''Creation''' who is connected to the [[Ladybug Miraculous]], and with her power, its [[Miraculous holders|wearer]] can use the earrings to transform into a ladybug-themed superhero, the current wearer being [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]].

== Appearance ==
Tikki is a small crimson creature that is 10 centimeters (or 4 inches) tall.&lt;ref&gt;https://officialmiraculousladybug.tumblr.com/post/159429418797/do-you-have-a-fun-fact-about-tikki&lt;/ref&gt; She has a tiny body, a large head, dark blue eyes, and freckles across her face.&lt;ref&gt;https://officialmiraculousladybug.tumblr.com/post/159888653657/hi-did-u-know-that-tikki-has-freckles&lt;/ref&gt; She resembles a ladybug, with two antennae, a large black spot on her forehead, back, and each side of her head, and a short tail with three tips aligned vertically.

{{For2|more of Tikki's outfits and designs|Tikki/Designs}}


== Personality ==
[[File:DC S01EP10 (105).png|left|thumb|Tikki, not understanding Marinette's idiom, about to pinch her.]]
Tikki is calm and collected while being optimistic, loving, kind, and encouraging.&lt;ref&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Qry0SBvmdNZjBrckwxb1Y4TU0/view?pli=1&lt;/ref&gt; She is very understanding towards others, commended Marinette for not telling Cat Noir her secret identity in &quot;Lady Wifi&quot; and comprehended with Marinette's parent's decision of grounding her, mindful that Ladybug's responsibilities for keeping her identity a secret is important.

In &quot;[[Syren]]&quot;, where she and Wayzz understood the danger of what would happen if she or any other kwami were captured with the Miraculous spellbook's knowledge, showing her curious, obedient and loyal side.

Having a lot of wisdom and is always looking for the bright side of things, Tikki is very open to giving advice, and she will call people out for bad decisions if necessary. According to Marinette in &quot;[[Tikki (webisode)]]&quot;, she is quite observant, as seen in &quot;Mr. Pigeon&quot; where she called [[Xavier Ramier]] a unique character like a &quot;human bird&quot;, inspiring Marinette to make a pigeon derby hat.

Although she can become annoyed or exasperated with others, Tikki doesn't stay upset at them for long, only wanting what's best for them and those around them. She can be hurt or displeased when someone isn't paying attention or appreciates her, displeased with Marinette unintentionally disregards her gift to her in &quot;[[Befana]]&quot;. Tikki believes in the importance of saving the world above her own needs, even willing to help Marinette transform instead of seeing [[Wang Fu]] and getting herself healed in &quot;[[Princess Fragrance]]&quot; meaning that she is dedicated to her responsibility as a kwami although a bit reckless. She can also act a bit rash if she needs to achieve something important, like getting the [[Miraculous spellbook]] from [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]] in &quot;[[Volpina]]&quot;.

Tikki tends to take things literally, when Marinette asked the question, &quot;Please tell me I didn't just do that?&quot; and answered her in &quot;The Mime&quot;. As well as in &quot;Dark Cupid&quot;, like when Marinette asks someone to pinch her, thinking she means it or when she believes Alya is heading to a dentist because she didn't understand what a surprise party was or how humans celebrate their birthdays. Sometimes, Tikki shows a more playful and affectionate side, playing an air guitar solo with Marinette in &quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot; and playing a pretend fencing match with her in &quot;[[Riposte]]&quot;. Unlike Plagg and as described by Marinette in &quot;Despair Bear&quot;, she has a sweet tooth which means she isn't a picky eater and is willing to try different foods to get her energy back up or just out of curiosity, as seen in &quot;[[Despair Bear]]&quot; and &quot;[[Glaciator]]&quot;, but one of her apparent favorite foods is chocolate chip cookies as seen in multiple episodes in Season 1 and 2.

However, she is honest to where she admitted to Marinette the importance of a kwami's cycle. Also in &quot;Heroes' Day&quot;, where she encouraged Marinette to be honest about her mistake. She was also disappointed with Marinette when she wasn't being honest with her feelings towards Cat Noir during &quot;Weredad&quot;, with Chris in &quot;Christmaster&quot; and her grandfather in &quot;[[Bakerix]]&quot;. Although it's rarely seen Tikki does have a bit of a temper seen in &quot;Oblivio&quot; when Plagg refused to help.

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;Ikari Gozen&quot;, Tikki isn't judgmental as she is willing to give others a chance and respectful towards other people's privacy as she tried to stop Marinette from looking through Kagami's phone. Another rarely seen side of Tikki is that she can be a bit hesitant and panicky in a time of crisis seen in &quot;Reflekdoll&quot;. }}

== Abilities ==
[[File:LB_Transformation_(11).png|thumb|left|Tikki entering the Ladybug Miraculous.]] Tikki is able to fly and levitate simultaneously. She also can pass through solid objects, such as a locker door so she can unlock it during &quot;[[Copycat]]&quot; while helping Marinette get Adrien's [[Adrien's cellphone|phone]] or the lock of Marinette's chains, which she opened in &quot;[[Captain Hardrock]]&quot;. She can also carry things that weigh more than her, such as bringing an apple to Marinette without struggle until she trips over a spool of thread in &quot;[[Mr. Pigeon]]&quot;.

In &quot;Gamer 2.0&quot;, Tikki is even strong enough to carry a History Book without much struggle.

As a kwami, Tikki gives the wearer the power of creation (good luck) and transforms them into a ladybug-themed superhero by entering the Ladybug Miraculous. Although unable to communicate to the wearer while they are transformed, she usually knows what is going on during that time, being aware that Marinette wasted her power as Ladybug due to jealousy in &quot;The Bubbler&quot; and saying to her that it was cool she complimented [[Alya Césaire|Alya]] when she was surrounded by the press earlier in &quot;[[The Mime]]&quot;. Whenever the wearer uses [[Lucky Charm]], Tikki begins losing power and eventually detransforms in about 5 minutes. Then Tikki has to recharge by eating.

When fed the correct potion, Tikki can access a form known as &quot;Aqua Tikki&quot;. Aqua Tikki is able to provide her holder additional abilities, such as breathing underwater and additional parts to their suit, such as flippers. When fed the ice potion, Tikki can access a form known as &quot;Stalac Tikki&quot;. Stalac Tikki is able to provide her holder additional parts to their suit, such as skates.

{{HideSpoiler|It seems that Tikki can fuse her powers with Longg's to create the hybrid wielder [[Dragon Bug]].}}

== Trivia ==
* [[File:PV HQ (2).png|thumb|Marinette cuddling Tikki in the Ladybug PV.]] Tikki's current design is different than it was in the Ladybug PV. In the PV, she is red with a dark brown four-leaf clover on her forehead and black eyes, and she is much bigger, being around the size of Marinette's head.
* Tikki is the only kwami who is referred to by the feminine pronoun in Season 1.
** This is true in every dub except for the Korean and Turkish dubs, where [[Nooroo]] is considered female.
* Tikki's name means &quot;happiness&quot; in another language.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/648192736970022912&lt;/ref&gt;
** Her name may also be based on the Estonian word &quot;teke&quot;, meaning &quot;creation.&quot;
* Tikki is based on ladybugs, who are known as symbols of love, good luck, and protection.
* She is the first and oldest kwami, having formed when the universe came to be, as revealed in the second issue of ''Miraculous Adventures''.
* There have been cases where Tikki has been accidentally heard or noticed by people.
** Alya overhears Marinette's and Tikki's conversation in &quot;Lady Wifi&quot; and &quot;The Mime&quot;.
** Cat Noir almost sees Tikki when he is trapped with Marinette in &quot;The Evillustrator&quot;, but Marinette manages to hide her.
** Tikki accidentally flung out of Marinette's purse in &quot;Princess Fragrance&quot;, and pretends to be a doll when Chloé finds her.
*** In the same episode, Marinette describes her as a special breed of cat to Wang Fu.
** In &quot;Animan&quot;, Alya overhears Marinette talking to Tikki over the phone, but she believes she is talking to her.
** In &quot;Pixelator&quot;, two civilians notice Tikki in Marinette's purse and she pretends to be a cat when spotted.
** [[Adrien's bodyguard]] sees Marinette talking to Tikki while she's in her [[Marinette's purse|purse]] in &quot;Guitar Villain&quot; and looks at Marinette suspiciously.
** Tikki is almost seen by Cat Noir in &quot;Befana&quot; when Marinette attempts to transform but she stops before he gets to her.
* In an interview, [[Mela Lee]] revealed that Tikki likes baking, but that she is too small to bake, and so she will spend time just reading recipe books.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk_1vVwlAQE&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Webisode &quot;[[Homework Essay]]&quot;, Marinette wants to write an essay about how inspiring Tikki is but is prevented from doing so by the fact kwamis are meant to be kept secret.
* In &quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;, just as Marinette doesn't like to be called Bugaboo by Cat Noir; Tikki doesn't like to be called Sugar Cube by Plagg.
* In &quot;[[Oblivio]]&quot;, Tikki is shown to be ticklish.
* In &quot;[[Bakerix]]&quot;, Tikki's amazement at the Channel Tunnel and at all the things humans have invented since the last time she had an owner implies that she didn't have a chosen before Marinette since at least before 1988.

== Trivia ==
* Many of the characters' designs are regular background models used in groups and crowds in the series. For example, the background model of August's mother has been used multiple times in episodes, like in &quot;[[The Mime]]&quot; or &quot;[[Glaciator]]&quot;.
* Chris and Fred are often mistaken as pantomime performers. Pantomime is actually a British form of theater that takes place around Christmas and usually involves throwing candy at audiences.
* In the French version, Sarah is named &quot;Josiane&quot; after the French actress [[Josiane Balasko]], who also voiced the character.
** Additionally, in the French version, she is director of Fred's show.
* Lila's mother and Clara Contard uses the same background model, but according to [[Thomas Astruc]], they are not the same character, and it was an animation mistake that both characters use the same model&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/1053980672627560448&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clara Contard's name is a pun on the French word ''racontar'', which means &quot;gossip.&quot;
* Jean's full name is a wordplay on the phrase ''j'entretiens'', which means &quot;I maintain.&quot;

{{SpoilerButton}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the [[Kwamis|kwami]] of '''Destruction''' who is connected to the [[Cat Miraculous]], and with his power, its [[Miraculous holders|wearer]] can use the [[Miraculouses|ring]] to transform into a black cat-themed hero, the current wearer being [[Adrien Agreste]].

== Appearance ==
Plagg is a small black creature that is 10 centimeters (or 4 inches) tall.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/1209Sina/status/854076394917310464&lt;/ref&gt; He has a large head and small body. His appearance is very cat-like, having cat ears, a tail, two cat incisors, and green cat-like eyes, along with one whisker on his forehead and one dark blue whisker on each cheek. With the insides of his mouth being purple.

{{For2|more of Plagg's designs|Plagg/Designs}}


== Personality ==
[[File:VP_(822).png|thumb|left|Plagg is skeptical towards Adrien's plan to defeat Volpina.]]
At his best, Plagg can be described as being carefree and easygoing. At his worst, he is negligent, overindulgent, lazy, and sour. He isn't very helpful and doesn't take situations quite as seriously as he should.&lt;ref&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Qry0SBvmdNZjBrckwxb1Y4TU0/view?pli=1&lt;/ref&gt; Quite the picky eater, he only enjoys eating cheese, especially Camembert, which Adrien will feed him not only in order to fuel his transformation into Cat Noir, but also to bribe him when he's not being helpful. He seems to like anything that is shiny and will also get distracted by anything that resembles Camembert, including [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]]'s [[Chloé's bracelet|bracelet]]. Often making bad choices, like playing with Chloé's bracelet and causing an argument of it being stolen in the class after it gets stuck on his head, Plagg can be quite troublesome. He also seems to find others' misfortunes amusing, especially Adrien's, along with dirty secrets that they keep. However, Plagg does have a kinder side that comes out, and he will be serious if the situation requires him to be. He tries to stop Adrien from transforming, as he hasn't finished explaining everything about the Cat Miraculous, in &quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)|Ladybug &amp;amp; Cat Noir]]&quot;, and he thinks Adrien's idea to talk [[Lila Rossi|Volpina]] out of causing harm isn't as useful as being Cat Noir is in the [[Volpina|episode of the same name]].

Plagg can be quite curious at times when he flew off into Chloé's bag in &quot;Rogercop&quot;, wanting to know what was in Gabriel's safe in &quot;Volpina&quot; or wanting to see who Ladybug really was in &quot;Lady Wifi&quot; and when he flew around Adrien's room for the first time in &quot;Origins Part 1&quot; looking for food. Unlike Adrien, Plagg doesn't mind being cooped up and is optimistic and willing to look on the brighter side of things as seen in &quot;[[The Collector]]&quot; and &quot;[[Captain Hardrock]]&quot;.

At times, Plagg can be secretive but loyal seen in &quot;[[Syren]]&quot; where he refused to tell any secrets about Master Wang Fu.

According to Adrien in &quot;[[Plagg (webisode)|Plagg]]&quot;, he is out of control and arrogant. Also that his guilty pleasure is Camembert to the point where he has a bit of a one track mind or in Adrien's words, &quot;He's always thinking with his stomach. In &quot;Sandboy&quot; Plagg shows his sensitive side when he cries out of worry for Nooroo. He also displays a clever side when he tricks Sandboy into the path of an upcoming subway train when the villain was chasing him.

Plagg also cares deeply about Adrien, best seen in &quot;Syren&quot;, when he tells Adrien that Cat Noir is replaceable but not him. Also in &quot;Sandboy&quot;, when he calls Adrien the best Cat Noir he's ever had. According to Master Fu in &quot;Style Queen&quot;, Plagg is reckless and rebellious without the guidance of an owner and when he disobeyed Master Wang's order to stay put.

In &quot;Oblivio&quot;, he calls himself brave and a free-spirit. Plagg can also be playful and bit of a prankster at times as he enjoyed playing the piano with Adrien and was playing with one of the wax figurine heads in &quot;Puppeteer 2&quot;.

Unlike Adrien, Plagg is more cautious around those who are suspicious or sneaky and like Trixx is a good judge of character as he described Lila as not good friend for Adrien.

{{HideSpoiler|Outside of his carefree and easygoing part of his personality, Plagg can be cool, calm, collected, focused and encouraging seen in &quot;Reflekdoll&quot;. He isn't afraid to speak his mind with something is a bad idea like when Adrien took Ladybug's offer accepting the Snake Miraculous especially when his owner kept being distracted seen in &quot;Desperada&quot;.}}

== Abilities ==
[[File:OR1-(588).png|thumb|left|Plagg holding a remote control to Adrien's TV.]]
Plagg is able to fly and levitate. Despite being small, he can carry objects larger or heavier than him, such as a large slice of camembert or a TV remote. He can also pass through solid objects, like in &quot;Volpina&quot; when he phases through [[Gabriel Agreste]]'s safe to get inside and unlock it for Adrien.
[[File:CNTS_19.png|thumb|Plagg entering the Cat Miraculous when Adrien says &quot;Plagg, Claws out!&quot;.]]
As a kwami, Plagg gives the wearer the power of destruction and transforms them into a black cat-themed superhero by entering the Cat Miraculous. Plagg, during the time his wearer is transformed, is aware of what is going on, albeit not able to communicate with them. For example, in &quot;[[Dark Cupid]]&quot;, he remembers the events going on while Adrien was under the influence of Dark Cupid's arrow and informs him that he was rude to Ladybug and he fought against her. Whenever the wearer uses [[Cataclysm]], Plagg begins losing power and eventually detransforms in about 5 minutes. Plagg has to recharge by eating Camembert, which Adrien doesn't like the smell of.

When fed the correct potion, Plagg can access a form known as &quot;Aqua Plagg&quot;. Aqua Plagg is able to provide his holder additional abilities, such as breathing underwater and additional parts to their suit, such as flippers. Or when fed the ice potion, Plagg can access a form known as &quot;Plagg Glacier&quot;. Plagg Glacier is able to provide his holder additional parts to their suit such as ice skates.

Plagg is also able to use Cataclysm himself without inhabiting a Miraculous. This is shown in &quot;Style Queen&quot; when he uses it to destroy the [[Eiffel Tower]] and cause significant damage to a very wide range of the surrounding area.

He seems to be extremely powerful, and when not restricted by his wearer is capable of causing untold destruction. According to Master Fu, he is heavily implied to be responsible for the leaning tower of Pisa, the destruction of Atlantis and, most notably, the extinction of the dinosaurs (however, Plagg said that he simply didn’t see the tower of Pisa when he flew into it and he had too much cheese in Atlantis, but did admit he went a bit overboard with the dinosaurs).

Interestingly enough he can control his powers when he wants to just as when Plagg used Cataclysm on the street to free Adrien in &quot;Catalyst&quot;.

{{HideSpoiler|It seems that Plagg can fuse his powers with Sass' to create the hybrid wielder [[Snake Noir]].}}

== Trivia ==
* Plagg's name is based on the word &quot;plague.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/648192736970022912&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plagg is based on a black cat, which in some cultures is a symbol of bad luck.
* For Plagg, while doing the English dialogue needed for animating the show, [[Matthew Géczy]] used a British accent. [[File:PV_LQ_(46).png|thumb|180px|Plagg snickering at Félix's misfortune.]]
* He was bigger in the Ladybug PV, being around the size of [[Félix Agreste|Félix]]'s head.
* Plagg does not like to eat any food besides cheese.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MoonieBalloonie/status/756967343620620292&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several times when he eats something that is not Camembert in order to recharge.
** In the third issue of ''Miraculous Adventures'', he reluctantly eats a granola bar.
** Also, in &quot;The Puppeteer&quot;, he appears to display interest in &quot;buttery popcorn&quot;.
** In &quot;The Dark Owl&quot;, he shares a macaron from Marinette's bakery with Tikki.
* He is the first kwami to have their Miraculous destroyed, it being erased with Cat Noir in &quot;Timebreaker&quot; by the [[Alix Kubdel|villain of the same name]]. However, this outcome is prevented when Ladybug goes back in time and stops her.
* In &quot;Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir&quot;, he tells Adrien that he met the genie of the lamp in the past.
* Plagg enjoys playing like a puppy and watching TV.&lt;ref&gt;https://officialmiraculousladybug.tumblr.com/post/159430554187/any-fun-facts-about-plagg&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plagg keeps a stash of Camembert in a cupboard in Adrien's room, as seen in &quot;[[Sapotis]]&quot;.
* According to Master Fu in &quot;Style Queen&quot;, it is stated that Plagg caused the sinking of Atlantis, the tilting of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and the extinction of the dinosaurs.
** With that incident it could be possible that Plagg had an owner while in Italy or he somehow became active while under the ownership of another guardian. 
* [[Tikki]] called Plagg &quot;Stinky Sock&quot; in &quot;Sandboy&quot;.
* Plagg is the first kwami to use his powers without his owners in both his physical form in &quot;[[Style Queen (Queen's Battle - Part 1)|Style Queen]]&quot;, &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)|Catalyst]]&quot;, and in his spirit form when the dinosaurs went extinct.
*Plagg may have romantic feelings for [[Tikki]] because he calls her “Sugarcube” and asks to dance with her in [[Sandboy]].

{{Quote|Knowing how [[Ali|you]] always help sick children around the world, I just want you to know that you're the most kindhearted person I ever met!|Rose|&quot;[[Princess Fragrance]]&quot;|quotelink = yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/755033027823046656&lt;/ref&gt; is a student in [[Miss Bustier's class]] at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]]. 

In &quot;[[Princess Fragrance]]&quot;, after [[Chloé Bourgeois]] taunts Rose and tears up her letter to [[Ali|Prince Ali]], she is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and becomes '''Princess Fragrance''', a perfume-shooting [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]]. 

{{HideSpoiler| In &quot;[[Félix (episode)|Félix]]&quot; she is, along with Alya and Juleka, akumatized by Hawk Moth into the '''Trio Of Punishers''', a group of supervillains.}}

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Rose is 4'11 with a blonde pixie cut hair, periwinkle eyes, and pink lipstick.

=== Civilian attire ===
She wears a shirt with light pink sleeves and top front, pink and white stripes on the front, a pink back that has a pale golden wing design, and string tied around her waist. She also has a pink mini skirt with two white edges at the bottom of the cloth, white leggings, two pink bracelets around her right wrist, and pink dress shoes.

=== As Princess Fragrance ===
Princess Fragrance's skin is a pale green and her sclera are light pink. Her hair is now pink with lighter pink edges on her bangs. It is long and tied back into a rosebud-like bun, (hence her name) and detailed with black horizontal lines and black leaves around the bottom half. A black tube comes out of the top of the bun and hangs down to the back of her knees, and the end of her hair comes out of the end and is tied with a black band. Like a mask, black paint is around her upper face and over eyes, a swirl below her left eye. She also has pink lipstick.

Her outfit is a black jumpsuit and covers her arms, legs, and neck. Narrow pink lines go down her puffed sleeves and puffed shorts, and they make a rose design on her chest. Her shoes are high heels, having pink heels and pointed pink tips to her toes. Her blaster is a dark purple tear-shaped bottle with pink horizontal lines, and the end is clear, rounded, light pink glass surrounded by dark gray leaf-like edges where it attaches to the bottle. Through the bottle and out of the end of the glass is a small dark gray pipe, which is where the perfume shoots out from. The handle and the trigger are thin, curled dark gray metal wire, and over one part of the handle near the back, there is a round, dark purple piece with indented lines spiraling around it.

== Personality ==
[[File:HF S01EP11 (443).png|thumb|Rose offering a snack to her classmates as they leave the classroom.|left]]
Rose is a sweet, cheerful and naive teenage girl.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://miraculeusecoccinelle.tumblr.com/post/129733355946/miraculous-les-aventures-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir&lt;/ref&gt; With an optimistic and happy attitude, Rose cares for everyone around her, often showing much gratitude, and she likes helping them, offering snacks and drinks to her classmates during their movie project in &quot;[[Horrificator]]&quot;. Her kindness can occasionally lead her to a downfall (as she is naive), though, such as in the episode &quot;[[Timebreaker]]&quot; when [[Alix Kubdel|the title character]] tricks her into helping her stand up and thereby erases her from time. She is also very sensitive, easily becoming frightened to run for class representative after competitor Chloé threatens to kick her out of the scrapbooking club in &quot;[[Darkblade]]&quot;. In &quot;Befana&quot;, Rose can be very brave when standing up for her friends. Her courage is further shown in &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot;, in which she risks herself to save Chloé from the [[Caline Bustier|titular villain]]'s minions. 

As Princess Fragrance, she is obsessed with [[Prince Ali]] and will stop at nothing to accomplish her goal to make him hers. She expects people to treat her like royalty, and she is particularly enraged by people who won't follow her or take Prince Ali away from her. She also likes to sing and makes everyone under her control sing.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
In &quot;Zombizou&quot;, Rose is fairly physically strong as she is able to carry [[Chloé Bourgeois]], although just barely. In &quot;Reverser&quot;, Rose is good at writing music lyrics.
Shown in “Captain Hardrock”, Rose is a very good singer in her band ''Kitty Section''.

=== As Princess Fragrance ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
As Princess Fragrance, Rose's perfume bottle becomes a gun that can spray different scents, each with its own unique abilities. The barrel of the gun changes color to signify which one is being used. There are two types of scents seen:
* The pink spray brainwashes anyone into serving her. Those affected will do whatever she says and will speak only in song.
* The green spray makes whoever it hits give off a horrendous stench.

If she points the gun downwards and continually shoots perfume, it propels her into and through the sky, allowing her to fly.

== Family ==
{{Lavillant Tree}}

== Relationships ==
=== [[Juleka Couffaine]] ===
[[File:RK (33).png|left|thumb|Rose leaning on Juleka's shoulder.]] Juleka is Rose's best friends as they often hang out together during breaks and between classes. If Juleka ever needs help and support, Rose willingly gives it to her and she worries for Juleka if she is upset. She reassures Juleka that she isn't cursed and will get a good picture of herself for class picture day in &quot;[[Reflekta]]&quot;, and she is consequently mortified when Chloé prevents Juleka from being in the photo. In &quot;[[The Notebook]]&quot;, Rose appreciates Juleka calling her awesome and writing it in her [[Rose's notebook|notebook]] as a way to cheer her up. They are both members of the band [[Kitty Section]] in &quot;[[Captain Hardrock]]&quot;, Rose being the lead singer and Juleka playing guitar.

In &quot;Zombizou&quot;, Rose is comforted and cuddled by Juleka after her close call with Zombizou's minions until it's revealed Rose got infected with Zombizou's kiss and is implied to have kissed Juleka to infect her as well; the two are even holding hands and even share a hug after they are returned to normal. In &quot;Reverser&quot;, they both are members of the school Art Club.

=== [[Ali|Prince Ali]] ===
[[File:Princess Fragrance 1156.png|thumb|Rose tells Prince Ali how she feels for him.]] Rose is a very big fan of Prince Ali, even writing him a letter expressing her thanks for all the kind things he does. At the end of &quot;Princess Fragrance&quot;, Rose finally gets to reveal her gratitude towards him and befriends him.

When she is Princess Fragrance, she is passionately fixated on him, declaring him as her &quot;prince&quot; and planning to wed him. When they are interrupted by [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]], she tries to make [[Paris]] their kingdom for them to rule. When that fails, she suggests running away from Paris with him.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] ===
[[File:The_Notebook_(8).png|left|thumb|Marinette and [[Alya Césaire]] commenting on Rose and her notebook.]] Rose is good friends with Marinette. When Rose is trying to help Juleka break her photo curse, Marinette's help means a lot to Rose, and she is very happy that they were able to succeed in their efforts after school in the park. Rose is also warmed by Marinette's compliment and drawing for her in her notebook. She has hung out with Marinette on several occasions, such as modeling her hats and jewelry in &quot;[[Despair Bear]].&quot; In &quot;[[Befana]],&quot; Rose comes to Marinette's birthday party and calls Marinette the sweetest person in the world when [[Gina Dupain|Befana]] threatens her. In &quot;[[Gigantitan]],&quot; Rose, like the others, already knows that Marinette has a crush on Adrien and approves of it. She works with her friends to help Marinette plan a date with Adrien, but when Marinette turns down Adrien's offer of a ride she praises her friend for making a great effort. During &quot;[[Gorizilla]],&quot; while waiting for Marinette, Rose was surprised to see pictures of her together with Adrien, saying, &quot;They're so cute together!&quot; 

Like many people, Rose highly appreciates Ladybug. In &quot;Gigantitan,&quot; she even works with [[Alya Césaire]] and the others to help Ladybug get out of the villain's grip. However, as Princess Fragrance, she is very enraged at Ladybug ruining her wedding and figuring out to plug her nose in order to avoid the effect of the perfume.

=== [[Alya Césaire]] ===
Alya is also one of Rose's friends. Alya's kind comment towards her that she writes in her notebook helps to cheer Rose up. In &quot;[[Busy Day]]&quot;, Rose joins Alya in Alya's plan for them and Juleka Couffaine to help Marinette and her parents finish a large order of macaroons.

The two friends enjoy spending time with each other, as seen in &quot;Gorizilla&quot; where they were going swimming at the pool, seeing a movie in &quot;[[Syren]]&quot;, and taking part in [[Clara Nightingale]]'s new music video in &quot;[[Frightningale]]&quot;.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:Princess Fragrance 274.png|thumb|Rose picking up the pieces of her letter that was ripped apart by Chloé.]]

Rose is both wary and fearful of Chloé, though she tries to be nice to her. In &quot;Princess Fragrance&quot;, she optimistically asks Chloé to take her letter for Prince Ali to him, only for her hope to be shattered when Chloé sneers at her request and destroys her letter. Chloé sabotaging Juleka Couffaine's chance to be in the class photo just so she'll be able to stand next to [[Adrien Agreste]] greatly upsets Rose, calling it &quot;one of Chloé's mean tricks.&quot; It also takes her friends' encouragement to cheer her up after Chloé insults her notebook. In &quot;Zombizou&quot;, despite knowing that Chloé isn't the nicest person, she disregards her own safety to save her.

While she is Princess Fragrance, she gets revenge on Chloé destroying her letter to Prince Ali by spraying a stinky perfume onto her.

== Trivia ==
* In the Latin American dub, Rose's name is Rosita.
* During the derby hat competition in &quot;Mr. Pigeon&quot;, Rose and Juleka are standing next to a derby hat with gears attached to it, suggesting one of them or both made the hat.
* An earlier concept design for Rose includes her hair being slightly longer and curlier and her shoes having flowers on them.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Old Classroom Photo concept.png|Image]] from the [https://youtu.be/qpDCWD5G2jU 2014 Licensing Show Video].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the past class photo seen in &quot;Reflekta&quot;, Rose has longer, roughly shoulder-length hair.
* In &quot;Princess Fragrance&quot;, &quot;The Evillustrator&quot;, &quot;Antibug&quot;, &quot;Reflekta&quot;, and &quot;Pixelator&quot;, it is shown that she is right-handed.
* She is the second shortest student in Miss Bustier's class, after Alix.
* In her webisode, &quot;Rose&quot;, it is revealed that she is the lead singer and the lyric writer of [[Kitty Section]].
* On May 17, 2017, the writers revealed that Princess Fragrance will reappear in [[Season 3]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://youtu.be/tBGO07cb0Aw?t=1458 Information revealed by the writers on May 17, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;
** Since then, it has been confirmed that a version of Princess Fragrance will appear in the two-part special event &quot;[[Heroes' Day]]&quot;. 
** However, due to the fact that the Heroes' Day two-parter was originally leaked as a Season 3 episode, but has since been confirmed as the finale of Season 2, the writers may have simply been referring to her appearance in this two-parter.
* In &quot;Reverser&quot;, Rose is part of the school's Art Club along with [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg]], Juleka Couffaine, Alix Kubdel and Marinette Dupain-Cheng. 
* In &quot;The Mime&quot;, Rose appears in the background alongside Juleka while Cat Noir is being tackled by the Mime under the Eiffel Tower.
* In the theme song, Rose has pig stickers on her photo.

'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/853374089611837440&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Kwamis|kwami]] of '''Subjection''' who is connected to the [[Bee Miraculous]] and with her power, its [[Miraculous holders|wearer]] can use the hair comb to transform into a bee-themed superhero. She is currently dormant in her Miraculous in the [[Miracle Box]], but she temporarily becomes active to help Chloé transform into Queen Bee.

== Appearance ==
Pollen is a yellow creature that is 10 centimeters (or 4 inches) tall.&lt;ref&gt;Confirmed to [[User:BelieveInMagic814]] by the official [https://officialmiraculousladybug.tumblr.com/ Miraculous Ladybug Tumblr blog].&lt;/ref&gt; Three curved stripes wrap around her head, and each stripe grows smaller as it ascends up her forehead. Her small stinger, visible at the rear, is also striped. Her antennae, arms, and feet are black, while her eyes are golden with blue sclerae. She has a row of white upper teeth, and she has black eyelashes. A small light yellow tuft is located below her head and around her neck, with a small area reaching onto her stomach.

{{For2|more of Pollen's designs|Pollen/Designs}}

== Personality ==
Pollen appears to have a formal and polite personality, greeting Tikki and Plagg as &quot;the noble kwamis of creation and destruction&quot; as shown in &quot;Sandboy&quot;.

As shown in &quot;Style Queen&quot;, &quot;Queen Wasp&quot;, and &quot;Malediktator&quot;, she is very submissive, obedient, and respectful towards her owner, as she calls Chloé &quot;My Queen&quot; and how she promptly transforms her into Queen Bee, despite it meaning everyone getting to know the latter's identity.

== Abilities ==
Pollen is able to fly, levitate, phase through solid objects, and carry objects larger and/or heavier than herself.

As a kwami, Pollen gives the wearer the power of subjection (the power to immobilize an opponent) and transforms them into a bee-themed superhero by entering the Bee Miraculous. Whenever the wearer uses [[Venom]], Pollen begins losing power and eventually detransforms in about five minutes. Pollen then has to recharge by eating.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
[[File:Pollen_Introduction.gif|thumb|left|Pollen greets Chloé]]
Not much is known about Pollen's relationship with Chloé, but as far as being seen, she has befriended Chloé quickly and is very respectful with her, calling her &quot;My Queen&quot;. She also doesn't object when Chloé transforms in front of a crowd of people.
{{Clear}}

=== [[Tikki]] and [[Plagg]] ===
[[File:SB_(177).png|thumb|Pollen greets Tikki and Plagg.]]
Just like with the other kwamis, Pollen seems to be good friends with Tikki and Plagg, formally greeting them as the &quot;noble kwamis of creation and destruction&quot; when they arrive inside the Miracle Box.

== Trivia ==
* Pollen was first revealed by [[Jeremy Zag]] with a picture posted on his Instagram. The image was captioned: &quot;New Kwami means new superhero!? 🤔.... hummm... Maybe! 😋👍 Miraculous Ladybug Season 2 is coming guys !!!!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BGuojclSQxG/&lt;/ref&gt;
** Another image of Pollen was shown during an interview between Lindalee Rose and [[Cristina Vee]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Lindalee &amp; Cristina Vee talk Miraculous Ladybug - *Spoilers* (MNN) Ep.3|Lindalee &amp; Cristina Vee talk Miraculous Ladybug - *Spoilers* (MNN) Ep.3]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The background of the teaser images is a blurred shot of [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] Cathedral.
* Pollen's name was revealed when [[Thomas Astruc]] confirmed a fan's correct guess during a Twitter contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* In concept art, Pollen's eyes had neither pupils nor irises, only their blue sclerae, and her sclerae were much darker.
* Though indirectly, Pollen is the first kwami to be akumatized.
** She is also the first to be akumatized twice.
* Astruc has stated that if the Miraculous is destroyed, the Kwami survives but is no longer able to be seen or felt. Thus, while the Bee Miraculous was destroyed, Pollen survived.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/1054706013239214080&lt;/ref&gt;
* The way Pollen is so ready to &quot;serve&quot; Chloé is a reflection on the way of how bees are devoted to their queen.
* Pollen's name and bee-like appearance is also a reflection on the symbiotic relationship bees have with flowers.

|quotelink = yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is one of the main protagonists of ''[[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]''. She is a student in [[Miss Bustier's class]] at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]] in [[Paris]], France and a budding fashion designer. With the [[Ladybug Miraculous]], when inhabited by [[Tikki]], Marinette transforms into the superheroine '''Ladybug''', gaining the power of creation to stop [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and his [[akumatized villains]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ab-international.com/Detail.aspx?Code=3420 Show Summary from Official Distributor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zagtoon.com/&lt;/ref&gt; She is also the leader of the [[French Miraculous superhero team]].

{{HideSpoiler|In “[[Reflekdoll]]”, Marinette obtains the [[Cat Miraculous]], which when inhabited by [[Plagg]], will be able to transform her into '''Lady Noir'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousINTL/status/1085864712343035905&lt;/ref&gt; ('''Lady Noire'''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.fr/Bandai-Miraculous-Ladybug-mannequin-Poup%C3%A9flekta/dp/B07R5VD7GW/&lt;/ref&gt; in the French version), gaining the power of destruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccxp18&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousINTL/status/1070793485802827776&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Marinette is a half French (by her father's side) and half Chinese (by her mother's side) teenage girl with medium-length black hair with blue reflections that is always seen tied back in two pigtails and bluebell eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Adrien writes that she has bluebell eyes in &quot;[[Dark Cupid]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/688380616493133824 and https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/664964573917761537 (the latter is an older tweet)&lt;/ref&gt; She also has light freckles on both sides and the bridge of her nose. She is also shown to stand at an average height.

=== Civilian attire ===
Marinette wears a dark gray blazer with rolled-up sleeves; the inside of the blazer is lined in white with pink polka dots and it has black trimming. Underneath, she wears a white t-shirt with black stitching and a flower design below the collar. The design itself has pink flowers and black leaves. She wears pink rolled up jeans and pink ballet flats with dark red soles. She wears eyeliner around her eyes and sports black earrings that also serve as her Miraculous when [[Tikki]] inhabits them. She often wears a light pink [[Marinette's purse|purse]] with a thin black strap over her right shoulder. 

=== As Ladybug ===
[[File:LB Mask on.gif|thumb|left|200px]]
As Ladybug, her hair becomes a slightly darker shade of blue. She wears a red skintight bodysuit covered in black spots and with a black collar/turtleneck. According to Marinette in &quot;[[Marinette's Double Life]]&quot;, her suit is made out of indestructible fabric. When not in use, she keeps her [[Yo-yo|yo-yo]] around her hips with a red string. On her face is a red mask with five black spots that are in a symmetrical design and the waterlines of her eyes are colored black. Her earrings are red with five black spots in a quincunx pattern and the bands holding her hair back become red ribbons, resembling a ladybug's wings when it's flying.

{{HideSpoiler|
===As Lady Noir ===
Lady Noir's suit is a lot like Cat Noir's; she wears a black skin-tight catsuit with neon green accents at the knees, forearms, waist and neck. Her hair turns jet black in color and is braided and long enough to touch the floor, making it look like a tail. She also has cat ears on top of her head like Cat Noir. Her eyes become green and catlike with green sclerae, lighter green irises and oblong pupils.

== Personality ==
[[File:EV S01EP08 (290).png|left|thumb|Marinette frustrated at her situation.]]
Marinette is a bit awkward, sweet, outgoing, joyful, and clumsy girl who loves fashion, her friends, family, and her crush, [[Adrien Agreste]]. Despite her outgoing and empathetic personality, Marinette struggles with self-confidence and self-esteem. In a situation, she deems urgent, like doing something for Adrien or losing something that will expose her secret identity, she becomes very nervous, awkward, and quick to panic. She's very helpful and is willing to help those who have insecurities, such as; [[Juleka Couffaine]] who thought she had a &quot;class photo curse&quot; and [[Marc Anciel]] who was too afraid to share his creative writing. However, opposed to that strength, Marinette herself losses confidence just by approaching her crush, Adrien, when in contact with a really big celebrity, or if she thinks others do greater success compared to herself. Marinette cares deeply for other people, usually putting their feelings and interests even before her own, in some cases at a personal cost. Despite being genuinely kind, she has her limits, such as in &quot;[[The Evillustrator]]&quot; when she gets irritated with [[Chloé Bourgeois]] to the point that she refuses to continue guarding her from the [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg|Evillustrator]] as Ladybug.

[[File:RC_S01EP09_(296).png|thumb|Marinette unintentionally accuses her classmates of theft.]]
Marinette can act impulsively and irrationally at times, as shown when she tried to deflect the false accusation of &quot;stealing&quot; Chloé's [[Chloé's bracelet|bracelet]] onto others who are also innocent. She also expresses jealousy whenever other girls such as Chloé or [[Lila Rossi]] flirt with Adrien, sometimes causing her to act irrationally, even abusing her powers as Ladybug to keep them away. However, she tends to learn from her mistakes and become a more open-minded, understanding person. Although she is absent-minded and acts before thinking at times, Marinette is clever, showing when she hid her signature in her hat when Chloé stole her design, thus exposing her. Furthermore, she is willing to do several risky tasks in order to protect her identity and image, like stealing Adrien's phone in &quot;[[Copycat]]&quot; to erase an embarrassing message she accidentally left on it. Thanks to her confidence as Ladybug, she's gotten more calm and comfortable around Adrien as herself, like as seen in &quot;[[Gorizilla]]&quot; when she helps him get away from a swarm of fans and talks to him more fluently.

[[File:AS_(70).png|thumb|left|Marinette gets irritated when Nora doubts Ladybug’s abilities.]]
In &quot;[[Frightningale]]&quot;, according to [[Clara Nightingale]], Marinette has a pure heart. Adrien also claims that she is funnier than Ladybug. She also takes her image and Miraculous powers as Ladybug very seriously, getting annoyed at Chloé playing her alter ego in Clara Nightingale’s music video and becoming a little angered in &quot;[[Anansi]]&quot; when Nora doubted her abilities. Also in &quot;Queen Wasp&quot;, when she got angry at Chloé as Ladybug for using her powers to create a fake accident which could have led to a serious one. She also takes advice from others very well whether it's family or friends seen in &quot;Malediktator&quot;, &quot;Heroes' Day&quot; and other episodes.

In &quot;[[Oblivio]]&quot;, despite Marinette being amnesiac from effects of Oblivio's powers, she is still quick-witted or as Adrien describes &quot;she is always able to come up with the right plan at the right time&quot;, outsmarting Oblivio while the villain was looking for her and Adrien.

[[File:CC (515).png|thumb|Ladybug preparing to jump and attack.]]
As Ladybug, Marinette retains many of her alter ego's characteristics, but she is much stronger. Her confidence and bravery come out more prominently.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:LadyBug 'Making of'|LadyBug 'Making of']]&lt;/ref&gt; Her quick-thinking, resourcefulness, and wits are more obvious, especially when she is figuring out how to utilize her [[Lucky Charm]]. Marinette strives to rescue everyone, including those akumatized by Hawk Moth. No matter the difficulty of her tasks, she does everything in her power to set things right while keeping up with her everyday responsibilities, like designing something or working in the bakery. Like [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]], Ladybug is clever with her words and occasionally enjoys making puns. She has a more serious side when fighting against Hawk Moth's villains, as opposed to Cat Noir's laid back and goofy personality. At times, she enjoys teasing him and others, while she can get exasperated, she handles joking calmly. Marinette as Ladybug, is more cautious and careful than Cat Noir sometimes needing to restrain or stop him from doing hasty acts seen in several episodes. According to Cat Noir, in &quot;Volpina&quot;, Ladybug can be stubborn at times when she wasn't easily convinced that Adrien was safe even finding it irresistible.

[[File:LW_S01EP07_(878).png|left|thumb|Marinette refuses to let Alya discover her secret identity.]]
As her alter ego, Marinette strives to keep her personal and superhero lives separate to protect herself, the people she knows, or is close to. She is also great at giving advice to others when they need it. With her greater confidence, she aims to be honest with others in other ways, like her honesty with Cat Noir about not having romantic feelings for him. In &quot;[[Mayura (Heroes' Day - Part 2)|Mayura]]&quot;, she also acknowledges that good things come by doing good actions and that not all problems can be solved by wishing them away, especially at the expense of hurting the innocent.

She is aware that there is a line between justice and revenge seen in &quot;Silencer&quot;. And that honesty and justice don't mean anything if you're pressured into doing it like as Ladybug she didn't pressure Bob to tell the truth about him stealing everything from Kitty Section but waited until he admitted everything himself across TV also showing she is very patient.

As time went on during rare occasions as Ladybug, she can act hasty at times when she's in a rush to do something or multiple things at one time seen in &quot;Gamer 2.0&quot;. And yet, at the same time she is more open about personal problems and seeking advice from others like Cat Noir in &quot;The Puppeteer 2&quot;.

While working with other Miraculous holders as team leader, she doesn't see them as sidekicks but as friends. Extremely valuing their support and help, however, Ladybug is saddened that she has to suspend those who do a great job but at the cost of having their identities revealed to Hawk Moth like Chloé and Kagami. But she does it in a caring and considerate way letting them know she does it to protect them and their loved ones.

{{HideSpoiler|As Lady Noir, Marinette retains most of personality as Ladybug like her cautiousness and creativity. As well as gaining her partner's sense of humor, cunning and charm with him believing that she's the one wearing the clown suit.}}

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
[[File:MP (977).png|thumb|Marinette working on a derby hat.|left]]''For a list of things made by Marinette, see the [[List of Marinette's creations]].''

Marinette has talent in fashion design as she is able to sketch ideas in a [[Marinette's sketch pads|notebook]] after getting inspired by certain surroundings or topics,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Marinette and Fashion]]&quot;, &quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Inspiration]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and sewing by hand or with a machine. Using computer software to create graphic designs is also an ability she possesses for creating things, such as [[Rock Giant|albums covers]]. She wears her own creations like her little purse and also makes things for others, such as the [[Tom &amp; Sabine Boulangerie Patisserie|bakery]]'s logo, [[Adrien's scarf]] and [[Jagged Stone's glasses]]. Her skills in this field are exceptional for an amateur, such as when her [[Marinette's derby hat|pigeon-styled derby hat]] that she made was good enough to be recognized by the famous professional designer, Gabriel Agreste, despite the fact that she had never made one before. As mentioned in the webisode &quot;Marinette and Fashion&quot;, she wants to be a fashion designer and have her own brand one day. 

Marinette is also very skilled at video games, easily beating Max at Ultimate Mecha Strike III and getting the highest score in the entire school. Marinette has high stamina, endurance, and agility, even in her civilian form, as displayed in &quot;[[Timebreaker]]&quot;. Marinette can also run long distances without stopping, as seen in several episodes. Marinette is naturally flexible, being even more flexible as Ladybug because of her enhanced physical abilities.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-57&quot;&gt;[[]]&lt;/sup&gt; She is also quite good at ice-skating. She is also quite stealthy, as she frequently sneaks up on Adrien and other people without being noticed.

Marinette is also very clever and uses her wit and resourcefulness to solve problems in many difficult situations shown in several episodes.

As complemented by Adrien in &quot;[[Despair Bear]] &quot;, Marinette is an excellent dancer and baker. In &quot;[[Riposte]] &quot;, Marinette has good reflexes, being on par with Adrien despite fencing for the first time. In &quot;[[Syren]]&quot;, she makes &quot;magicroons&quot; for Tikki containing all the power ups from Miraculous spellbook. Also in “[[Bakerix]]”, she knows both approaches, modern and traditional, on baking, as well as how to handle cooking facilities. 

=== As Ladybug ===
[[File:HF S01EP11 (827).png|thumb|Ladybug throwing her yo-yo.]]
Ladybug has much more enhanced skills; speed, agility, and strength that she is almost invulnerable to physical damage.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/660372597926993920&lt;/ref&gt; She has remarkable talent with wielding her yo-yo, like using it as a grappling hook, a rope to restrain others, a projectile, and even a shield if she spins it fast enough. After an evil [[akuma]] is released from its corrupted object, she can open her yo-yo, throw it to grab it, and remove the energy-charged it with, releasing it as a normal butterfly. She is skilled in hand to hand combat when fighting villains or Cat Noir when he ends up being controlled by one.
Similar to a real ladybug, she can climb up surfaces without her yo-yo since in &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot; and &quot;[[Frightningale]]&quot;. Her yo-yo can also work as a breathing apparatus for those who can't breathe underwater like herself in &quot;Reverser&quot;. Even out of &quot;Aqua Mode&quot;, Marinette is a good swimmer.

[[File:CC-Lucky-Charm-15.png|thumb|left|Ladybug calls upon her Lucky Charm.]]
Her special power, [[Lucky Charm]], helps her by summoning an [[List of Lucky Charm objects|object]] that she uses to achieve her objective, it often being to stop a villain. Though usually confused at first, her creativity and cleverness help enable her to perceive where the object can be used to help her achieve her goal, thinking up ideas and plans on her own. &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/922748986926288897&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lucky Charm drains her power and reverts her back to Marinette shortly afterward, so she has to use it wisely. Once the villain is dealt with, Ladybug can throw her Lucky Charm object into the air and use the [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]], which will make it revert back to energy and fix all of the damage done since the villain was created.

==== Aqua Form ====
When accessing her aqua powers, Ladybug has the ability to breathe underwater and enhanced swimming capabilities.

==== Ice Form ====
When accessing her ice powers, Ladybug has the ability to move freely and quickly on the ice with her ice skates.

{{HideSpoiler|
==== As Lady Noir ====
[[File:LAdy_noir.jpg|thumb|left|Marinette transforming into Lady Noir while as Reflekta.]]
She has the same abilities as her partner Cat Noir, such as more enhanced skills; like speed, agility, and strength that she is almost invulnerable to physical damage. Enhanced senses such as hearing, smell, night vision, and super stealth like a cat.

Along with her special power, Cataclysm, that allows her to negatively affect anything that she touches with her ring hand. While it is usually used to destroy objects, used for a variety of different effects, like causing a bus' controls to go haywire or creating a platform in a structure. However, using Cataclysm drains her Miraculous' power, causing her to revert back to Marinette typically five minutes afterwards, so she has to use it wisely.

Like Cat Noir she too can use her staff efficiently, wielding it as a sword, throwing it with great precision and having it be deflected back to him, being able to spin it at high speeds to form a shield, and taking advantage of its duplication and length-changing features. To travel long distances, she uses her staff and its variety in length to vault over obstacles. Her staff can also work as a breathing apparatus for those who can't breathe underwater like herself.}}

== Trivia ==
{{SpoilerButton}}
* The name '''Marinette''' has many meanings depending on the different languages: 
** In Hebrew, it means &quot;The one who rises&quot; or &quot;brings up&quot;
** In French, it means &quot;the good of people&quot;
*** In the English version, the pronunciation of the name '''Marinette''' with &quot;mar&quot; as in &quot;marinade&quot; is used, and in French, and other countries, the pronunciation with &quot;mar&quot; as in &quot;marred&quot; is used. 
* Marinette's surnames '''Dupain''' &amp; '''Cheng''' each have meanings to it. 
** The French surname '''Dupain''' means &quot;of the bread&quot; or &quot;bread&quot; (a reference to her father's job as a baker). 
** The Chinese surname '''Cheng''' means 成 &quot;completed, finished, succeeded&quot; (成 ) or &quot;sincere, honest, true&quot; (诚). 
*** However, 'Cheng' in Chinese when used as a surname is usually written as 陈.
* In &quot;[[Guitar Villain]]&quot;, it could be possible that Marinette is ambidextrous:
** She is seen designing [[Jagged Stone]]'s new [[Rock Giant|album]] with her right hand. 
** Near the end of the episode, when [[Adrien Agreste]] asks Marinette to sign Jagged Stone's new album, she is seen writing with her left hand. 
* In &quot;[[Dark Cupid]]&quot;, [[Alya Césaire]] mentions that Ladybugs are known to be symbols of good luck, especially in regards to love.
* [[Thomas Astruc]] created Ladybug around 2005 when he was exchanging drawings on post-it notes with another worker and made [[:File:First drawing of Ladybug by Thomas Astruc.jpg|one]] with the superheroine.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/698235435600977920&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://imgur.com/a/iU8ip ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Qry0SBvmdNZjBrckwxb1Y4TU0/view?pli=1 English translation])&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the fake comic book covers of ''The Mini Menace Ladybug'', Marinette's name was Marietta.[[File:PV HQ (1).png|thumb|Marinette from the Ladybug PV.]]
** In [[Befana]], [[Gina Dupain]] (Marinette's paternal grandma) calls Marinette '''Marinetta''', a possible nod to the fake comic book covers.
* Marinette's design has changed over time from the original Ladybug PV version.
** Her anime design included jean shorts, 
** As Ladybug, she had a red-orange face mask without black spots and two long red-orange ribbons attached to each pigtail. She also had longer hair and lacked freckles.
** In the PV, Marinette's earrings were always red with five spots, no matter if she was Ladybug or Marinette. She only wore them as a civilian when needing to transform, not having them in public.
*** PV Ladybug's costume differs from the CGI Ladybug as well, with PV Ladybug's spots being found only on her torso (her legs and feet were completely red) and wearing a ladybug-themed bag instead of having the yo-yo. PV Ladybug's hair and hair ribbons are also significantly longer than the current version of Ladybug, and she has an ahoge, which means &quot;foolish hair&quot; in Japanese.
*** The yo-yo didn't exist; PV Ladybug fought using hand-to-hand combat.
*** PV Ladybug was less shy around her crush, as she's able to be very close to [[Félix Agreste]] without panicking or being nervous. She even asks him out while slightly blushing and looking right at him, although Félix coldly refuses. [[File:Marinette render model.png|thumb|Marinette's older CGI design model.]]
** Marinette's CGI design seems to have gone through a change as well. Earlier footage and images of Marinette included dark blueish-black hair, red tips of hair at the end of her pigtails, and gray eyes.
*** In a placeholder animation, Ladybug was seen wielding a sword. Whether or not this was to be used as a new weapon or a Lucky Charm object is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Ux4OWMyNk&lt;/ref&gt;
** During the earlier stages of development, Ladybug wasn't allowed to abuse her powers of good luck, or else something bad would happen to her. As of now, it is unknown if Ladybug still has this issue, since, as seen in &quot;The Bubbler&quot;, all that happens when she selfishly uses Lucky Charm is that she runs out of power and loses her transformation.
** Both prototype versions of Marinette have her mask be the last piece of her costume to materialize during her transformation. In the final cartoon, her mask is instead the first piece to materialize.
* Her responsibilities as a superhero not only include fighting akumatized villains but also patrolling and many other things.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/660792250310524928&lt;/ref&gt;
* In &quot;[[Stormy Weather]]&quot;, Marinette's infatuation with Adrien is revealed to even include plans for a family. The names of their supposed children are Hugo, Emma, and Louis—all traditional French names. Aside from these, she also appears fond of dogs and especially hamsters.
** She briefly considers a black cat as well, but she rejects the idea.
* Although not having any romantic feelings towards Cat Noir, in the webisode &quot;Cat Noir as seen by Marinette&quot;, Marinette reveals that she's aware he may have a crush on her and she admits she might have given him a chance if Adrien hadn't been around.
* In &quot;Mr. Pigeon&quot;, Marinette's secret place of inspiration is the Trocadéro.
* In the Korean and French dubs of &quot;[[The Pharaoh]]&quot;, Alya says that Ladybug might be a 9th grader, while in the English dub of the episode she says she might be a 10th grader.
* In &quot;The Pharaoh&quot;, it is revealed that Ladybug's legacy is over 5,000 years old.
** Marinette is the third known person of French origins to wield the Ladybug Miraculous, succeeding her predecessors, [[Jeanne d'Arc]] and [[La Coccinelle]].
** Also, Marinette is the second person of Chinese origins to wield the Ladybug Miraculous, succeeding her predecessor [[Piáo Chóng]].
* Marinette is right-handed, but this changes depending on animation errors.&lt;ref&gt;http://miraculousladybug.wikia.com/wiki/File:..png Q&amp;A w/ Thomas Astruc&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marinette is naturally flexible, being even more flexible as Ladybug because of her enhanced physical abilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://miraculoushawkdaddy.tumblr.com/post/139190124946/its-marinette-flexible-or-is-a-ladybug-thing-i&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marinette has stolen both [[Adrien's cellphone|Adrien]]'s and [[Alya's cellphone|Alya's phones]] during the series. Ironically, however, both thefts were unintentional and involved her trying to hide a fact from the respective owners.
** She has also stolen and returned [[Chloé's cellphone|Chloé's phone]].
* Marinette sleeps with her pigtails on as seen in the opening of &quot;The Bubbler&quot; and the ending of &quot;The Pharaoh&quot;.
* In &quot;Troublemaker&quot;, her identity was nearly revealed in front of Cat Noir by the titular character.
* More of Marinette's Chinese heritage will be seen in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://officialmiraculousladybug.tumblr.com/post/158904756597/will-we-see-more-of-marinettes-chinese-heritage&lt;/ref&gt;
* Thomas revealed on Twitter that Marinette and Adrien will be seen as a &quot;real couple&quot; at some point in the show.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/869032971130613760&lt;/ref&gt;
** In &quot;[[Gorizilla]]&quot;, she was referred to as Adrien's girlfriend, though in that case, it was due to public misperception.
**During &quot;Oblivio&quot;, through their amnesic state Marinette and Adrien briefly become a couple until their memories were restored.
* In &quot;The Puppeteer&quot;, it's revealed that Marinette can whistle. 
* A fan asked Thomas why he gave Marinette ballet shoes, to which he jokingly responded with: &quot;Because with ski boots, you end up with stinking feet, and in addition it scratches the floor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/925870303015788544&lt;/ref&gt;
* Thomas confirmed that at some point in the future, Marinette will be seen with her hair down.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/963737768764628993&lt;/ref&gt;
* The way she throws her yo-yo in some episodes is similar to a baseball pitcher. 
* Marinette's hair color is a homage to old comic books that would use blue highlights on black hair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/666379398342434816 Thomas Astruc] posted a link to this [http://miraculouskittens.tumblr.com/post/133319326159/what-color-is-marinettes-hair article] about Marinette's hair by Tumblr user miraculouskittens.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In &quot;Gorizilla&quot;, Marinette reveals she hates horror movies.
* Thomas noted that Marinette would be hard to akumatize, as she is an optimistic person.&lt;ref&gt;Report on Thomas Astruc at Japan Weekend: https://twitter.com/Ladybug_Cartoon/status/780024002706305024&lt;/ref&gt;
** She was almost akumatized in &quot;Zombizou&quot;, but her negative emotions faded away before the akuma could infect an object of hers.
**This is seen again in &quot;Chameleon&quot;.
* In &quot;Reverser&quot;, Marinette attends art club along with [[Rose Lavillant]], [[Alix Kubdel]], [[Juleka Couffaine]], [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg]] and [[Marc Anciel]].
* In &quot;Sandboy&quot;, Marinette's greatest fears is Adrien being in love with Chloé and losing her powers as Ladybug, rendering her as a useless superhero, thus, being unable to save the day.
*In the webisode &quot;Marinette in Paris&quot;, Marinette says that her favorite monument is the Eiffel Tower.  
* Marinette has her own official Instagram account. You can find her under the username, [https://www.instagram.com/marinettedesigned/ @marinettedesigned].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/1152334692370309128&lt;/ref&gt;
** In one of her Instagram pictures according to Marinette, she drew her first fashion design ever when she was 5 or 6 years old.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/B1aj4ISAdaV/&lt;/ref&gt;
** In another one she mentions that she use to have a fear of getting lost in the Metro when she was younger.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/B0ZaBXeAAHC/&lt;/ref&gt;
** She used to do dance lessons with father.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/B0NOJOZg4yA/&lt;/ref&gt;
** In another picture Marinette mentions that she occasional takes part in taste testing her father's recipes. 
** She also created her signature flower design years ago.
** She also the Eiffel Tower as her source of inspiration when drawing new designs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/B1rlsOxgQIu/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* During a Q &amp; A on January 15, 2019, [[Jeremy Zag]] confirmed Ladybug and Cat Noir will reveal their identities and that it is already written.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousINTL/status/1085274395109675008&lt;/ref&gt;
** This is done in &quot;Oblivio&quot;, however, they were under the case of amnesia from the villain and had forgotten about the reveal once Ladybug restored everything with Miraculous Ladybug.
* According to [[Santa Claus]] in &quot;[[Christmaster]]&quot;, as her alter ego Ladybug, Marinette is the most well-behaved kid in the world.
* In &quot;Backwarder&quot;, Marinette was chosen by Master [[Wang Fu]] to become the next guardian of the Miracle Box if something happens to him.
* Following Plagg and Kagami, Marinette in &quot;The Puppeteer 2&quot;, is the only other person that knows that Adrien has a crush on another girl. But like Kagami she is unaware that Adrien is in love with Ladybug, who is her alter ego.
{{HideSpoiler|
* As of recent Season 3 spoilers, Marinette holds the record for the most miraculous used on one person following the [[Ladybug Miraculous]], the [[Cat Miraculous]], the [[Dragon Miraculous]], the [[Mouse Miraculous]] and the [[Fox Miraculous]]. 
* She holds the record for the most fusion forms with [[Dragon Bug]], and [[Multimouse with Fox Miraculous]].
** However, except for her current Ladybug form and her Lady Noir form in &quot;Reflekdoll,&quot; all of her other forms have yet to appear.
* As mentioned in &quot;Ikari Gozen,&quot; Marinette's Chinese Zodiac sign is a Snake.
** With Marinette's Chinese Zodiac sign as the snake, while Kagami says that she is a dragon. This could mean that Kagami is a year older than Marinette and Adrien. The most recent years of the snake are 2001 and 2013, while the recent years of the dragon have been 2000 and 2012; hinting that Marinette was born in 2001.
** With that and her birthday in July her astrological sign is either a Cancer or Leo.
** This may also be a nod to the fact, that both of her love interests ([[Luka Couffaine]] and [[Adrien Agreste]]) will wield/wielded the [[Snake Miraculous]] which is revealed in &quot;Desperada&quot;.
* In &quot;Reflekdoll&quot;, Marinette is working on a website to show off her designs.
* As of &quot;Cat Blanc&quot;, Marinette is the only one of Ms. Bustier's class and of the Miraculous French superhero team who hasn't been akumatized.
* Lady Noir was first revealed in concept art shown at the 2018 Comic Con Experience panel on December 6, 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccxp18&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousINTL/status/1070793485802827776&lt;/ref&gt;
** Marinette's role as the future holder of the [[Cat Miraculous]] was foreshadowed in the [[It's Ladybug|second opening]]. In which she was shown with cat ears, snout, whiskers and tail. 
* She is the first known female character to wield the Cat Miraculous.
* Lady Noir's name translates to &quot;Black Lady&quot;.
** The black part of her name is a reference to the black suit of the Cat Miraculous and not her heritage.

The '''art teacher''' is a professor who works at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]]. He teaches Art in Room 33.

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
The art teacher is a tall man with fair skin, gray eyes, and gray, swept-back, short hair.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a white long-sleeved shirt that is stained with paint under a grey vest. He also wears a brown belt, dark green pants, and dark boots.

== Personality ==
He is quite relaxed and calm, encouraging students to develop their artistic skills and inviting them to come to his room whenever they want to work on art projects. However, he stands firm when he notices someone being negative, such as when [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]] mocks [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg|Nathaniel]]'s drawings. He responds to this by telling her that she is welcome to work on her art project, but if she is not there to work, she is not welcome. He is nevertheless sad when Chloé leaves while it seemed that she had a project to work on.

{{Quote|But what if [Nathaniel] doesn't like it? I'll be so embarrassed. I'll have to change schools so I'll never run into him again.|Marc Anciel|[[Reverser]]|quotelink = yes}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a student at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MLUK&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/miraculous_uk/status/997824100746907648&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[Reverser]]&quot;, after [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg|Nathaniel]] disregards him and his writing, he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Reverser''', an inverting [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Marc is at average height and has a somewhat feminine appearance, with messy black hair, jade green eyes with visible lashes, thick eyebrows, pink lips, and a slender face with a pointed chin.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a red hooded jacket with white drawstrings and a white section on the back of the hood, lined with pink material. Underneath he wears a V-neck tie-dye shirt. He also appears to wear black fingerless gloves, ripped dark grey jeans with silver studs along the pockets and around the waist with a silver buckle, and black boots. His nails are painted black and he has a black choker around his neck.

=== As Reverser ===
Reverser is in a checkerboard patterned outfit. The left side of the outfit has solid black markings, like on the upper head, arm, fingers, chest, torso, and leg. On the right side, the lower head, palm, teeth and half of a circle on the chest are black. Reverser's weapon is a small black and white paper airplanes that can reverse the abilities or the personality of the person who is hit. He rides on a large paper hoverboard.

== Personality ==
=== As Marc ===
Like [[Juleka Couffaine|Juleka]], Marc is very shy and nervous around others. This is shown when Marinette pulls Marc into the art room to introduce him to everyone. He is also quite shy in front of his first friend at the school, Marinette, refusing to show her his stories. He likes to write stories (particularly about Ladybug and Nathaniel) but is sheepish and self-conscious when people read them. When he runs away in embarrassment out of the art room, he drops his notebook and Marinette picks it up and reads it. When she hands the notebook back to him later on, Marc immediately turns red. Like Marinette, he is clumsy and kind.

=== As Reverser ===
Reverser is demanding and clever, realizing that Ladybug's graceful agility made her difficult to strike. He endangered civilians in order to make Ladybug an easy target when she went to help the affected cyclist. He is also confident, leaning on a bit overconfident. After he struck Ladybug and Cat Noir with his airplanes, he sees the heroes as harmless and believed he had time to obtain his revenge on Nathaniel and Marinette before dealing with them.

== Abilities ==
=== As Marc ===
Marc is an excellent creative story writer. His Ladybug stories, based on Nathaniel's drawings, impress Marinette (the real Ladybug) so much that she pushes him to work with Nathaniel to make the Ladybug/Mighty Illustrator comic. Since the two of them complete the comic, it is implied that Marc's writing skills are strong enough for him to write well in script style as well as in short story style. 

=== As Reverser ===
Reserver has enhanced physical characteristics: speed, agility and strength. Reverser rides on a large paper hoverboard, which has the ability to fly around at will. He can also make small black and white paper airplanes with the ability to reverse the abilities or a personality trait to its opposite, by calling out what trait he wishes to reverse. Notable examples are when he made [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] become extremely clumsy after hitting her with a paper plane, or when he made [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] a coward. This can also affect specific actions, as Reverser was able to make [[André Bourgeois]] bring the trash containers in space back to Earth. 

== Relationships ==
=== [[Nathaniel Kurtzberg]] ===
[[File:RV_(90).png|thumb|left|Marc is amazed by Nathaniel's drawings.]] 
Marc often looks at Nathaniel's drawings online and uses them for inspiration for his stories. He is delighted when he gets a chance to see them in person. When Marinette suggests showing Nathaniel his writings so they can make a comic book together, Marc fears what might happen if Nathaniel doesn't like his stories, so he takes Marinette's offer of showing the book without saying who wrote it. But when Nathaniel angrily rejects Marc's offer of making a comic book together after mistakenly believing that the latter was playing a joke on him. Marc ends up getting so upset that he is akumatized by Hawk Moth. However, after he is deakumatized, the misunderstanding is cleared up, and the two create a comic book together.

[[File:Frozer_(162).png|thumb|Marc and Nathaniel continue to work together.]]
They can be seen together in later episodes such as &quot;[[Frozer]]&quot; and &quot;[[Mayura (Heroes' Day - Part 2)|Mayura]]&quot;. In &quot;Frozer&quot;, as Adrien is looking at each of the school's couples, Nathaniel and Marc are seen sitting on the staircase together looking at a book. In &quot;Mayura&quot;, Nathaniel places his hands on Marc's shoulders as they all cheer for Marinette which shows that their bond has deepened and that there is a high level of trust between the two. From the way Marc acts around and talks about Nathaniel, it can be inferred that Marc has a &quot;fondness&quot; toward him; this was later confirmed on Twitter by Feri.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-7&quot;&gt;[https://miraculousladybug.wikia.com/wiki/Marc_Anciel#cite_note-7 [8]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-8&quot;&gt;[https://miraculousladybug.wikia.com/wiki/Marc_Anciel#cite_note-8 [9]]&lt;/sup&gt;

As Reverser, he seeks revenge on Nathaniel for the emotional pain caused by his rejection. His intent is to reverse Nathaniel into being willing to make the comic book.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:RV_(26).png|thumb|left|Marc is shy about sharing his stories with Marinette.]] Marc appears to be on good terms with Marinette, but he is shy about showing his writings to her. Regardless, he takes her advice of teaming up with Nathaniel to create a comic book and allows her to give Nathaniel his writing without saying who wrote it. However, after a misunderstanding, Marc believes that Marinette is meddlesome and a liar. After he is deakumatized, though, he is no longer mad at her and along with Nathaniel dedicates their first Ladybug comic book to her.

Marc appears to be a fan of Ladybug and often writes stories inspired by her fights against akumatized villains. Also in &quot;[[Frightningale]]&quot;, he wears a Ladybug mask in Clara Nightingale's music video.

As Reverser, he targets Marinette, believing (partly correctly) that it is her fault that Nathaniel rejected him. His intent is to reverse her into being hated by everyone. However, he doesn't like her interfering with his plans. His strategic talent leads him to realize that he can force her into a vulnerable situation by targeting innocent bystanders, making her defend them.

== Trivia ==
* Marc made his first appearance in &quot;Frightningale&quot; as a dancer for [[Clara Nightingale]]'s music video alongside Nathaniel, [[Mylène Haprèle|Mylène]], [[Ivan Bruel|Ivan]], and [[Sabrina Raincomprix|Sabrina]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/dAFerisae/status/997862969387245568&lt;/ref&gt;
* His first name was revealed in a UK episode synopsis on May 19, 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;MLUK&quot; /&gt;
* His akumatized form was first seen in a photo taken by [[Jeremy Zag]] of the show's production for Season 2.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BVhzJMGAgVU/&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 21, 2018, [[Thomas Astruc]] revealed on Twitter that a (at the time unspecified) character was based on a personal friend of his named Hope Morphin, who is genderfluid and bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/HopeMorphin/status/1022169198271885312&lt;/ref&gt; A few hours after &quot;Reverser&quot; premiered on Family Channel, Morphin themself revealed that the character Astruc was referring to was Marc, and also that Marc is androgynous.&lt;ref name=&quot;:Twitter confirmation&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/HopeMorphin/status/1021503966599962624&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feri González]] confirmed this,&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/dAFerisae/status/1021757990632714240&lt;/ref&gt; and also later confirmed on Twitter that Marc identifies as part of the LGBTQ+ community and has &quot;fondness&quot; for Nathaniel.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/dAFerisae/status/1022199800383655936&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/dAFerisae/status/1022596614437797888&lt;/ref&gt;
** Marc's full name, Marc Anciel, is a play on the French word &quot;arc-en-ciel&quot;, which translates to &quot;rainbow&quot; in English. This wordplay both references his multicolored outfit and his being a part of the LGBTQ+ community.
*Hope Morphin has confirmed that Marc's three favorite animals are the sheep, peacock, and goat. This may foreshadow him getting the [[Goat Miraculous]] in future episodes. 
* His visible eyelashes and pink lips may imply that he wears makeup.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' was a [[Miraculous holders|Miraculous holder]] who is featured in the [[Miraculous spellbook]] for the [[Fox Miraculous]]. When [[Trixx]] inhabited the necklace, she transformed into a fox-themed superhero.

== Appearance ==
As depicted in the Miraculous spellbook, the Fox Miraculous holder had long black hair and bangs that she tied into two small side ponytails and one low ponytail, the tips of her ponytails being orange and white. She wore an orange cloth band around her head, its edges tied up and pointed like fox ears, and an orange cloth covered her nose and mouth. She wore an orange sleeveless tunic that was white on one upper edge and an orange sash wrapped around her shoulders. She also wore orange trousers, black knee-high cloth over her lower legs, black wristbands, and black shoes. Around her waist and hips was a wide white sash tied with an orange string, with one orange, white-tipped part of it falling being her like a fox's tail.

== Abilities ==
The Fox Miraculous holder used the [[Flute|flute]], as seen in the book illustration. And assuming that the past Fox Miraculous holder powers are the same as the recent Fox Miraculous holder ([[Alya Césaire|Alya]]). She would have had enhanced skills, such as speed, strength, and - most prominently - agility. She would also have the superpower [[Mirage]], allowing her to create illusions.

{{AppearancesS2|TC=p}}

== Trivia ==
* The [[Akumatized villains|akumatized villain]] [[Lila Rossi|Volpina]]'s design is strongly influenced by the past Fox Miraculous holder's illustration.
* In &quot;Volpina&quot;, [[Lila Rossi]] calls her an ancient vixen superhero and lies that her name is Volpina.
**However, it is unknown how Lila read the grimoire, because that is the name coded in the book and as mentioned by Nooroo in &quot;Syren&quot; only guardians can read it.
*** So it highly suggests that Lila knew to read nytcograph or she just took a guess.
* ''Húlí'' (狐狸) means &quot;fox&quot; in Chinese and the word isn't that far off from ''Fuli'' which means &quot;very fast&quot; in Swahili referring to a Fox Miraculous holder's superior agility.
* She is the earliest known out all the Volpinas starting the legacy

{{Nino Quote}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/752942731304075264&lt;/ref&gt; is a student in [[Miss Bustier's class]] at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien]]'s best friend. He also is a DJ and the head of the school radio.

In &quot;[[The Bubbler]]&quot;, when Nino becomes frustrated with adults after failing to convince [[Gabriel Agreste]] to allow Adrien to have a birthday party, Hawk Moth [[Akumatization|akumatizes]] him into '''Bubbler''', a bubble-wielding [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].

Starting from &quot;[[Anansi]]&quot;, whenever Nino receives the [[Turtle Miraculous]] from [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and commands [[Wayzz]] to inhabit the Miraculous, he becomes '''Carapace''', a turtle-themed superhero who helps Ladybug and Cat Noir &quot;during particularly difficult missions&quot; in the second season.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://pandasuite.com/viewer/2.0.2/59a6c26e48abe6f53a002dc9?t=1 (direct video source [https://data.pandasuite.com/videos/59a3e7def643f27d7300131b-universal_1024_1024_20_main_3-0.mp4 here])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;http://tvmag.lefigaro.fr/programme-tv/miraculous-les-secrets-de-la-saison-2-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir_d32cc720-a2c3-11e7-b619-f944cd28c6f6/&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[Mayura (Heroes' Day - Part 2)|Mayura]]&quot;, during the fight with Scarlet Moth, due to grief caused by watching [[Alya Césaire|Rena Rouge]] fall victim to an akuma, Carapace is in turn akumatized into '''Shell Shock''', a turtle-themed supervillain.

In &quot;[[Oblivio]]&quot;, due to his and Alya's embarrassment at being caught playing the ''[[Super Penguino]]'' game together, they are both akumatized into '''Oblivio''', a memory-erasing supervillain.

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Nino is tall, with short dark brown hair, tan skin, and amber eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a plain red cap, uses black-rimmed glasses, and often has a pair of dark gray, blue, and orange headphones hung around his neck. He typically wears a short-sleeved blue shirt with an eye design on the front (a design involving a black pupil, white sclera, a dark gray upper eyelid with lashes, and a light blue lower lid). Around his jeans is a brown belt, and while most of it is hidden by his shirt, one tip sticks out a little bit below the hem. Additionally, he wears lime green, pink, red, blue, and yellow wristbands around his right wrist, blue-gray jeans, and red and white high collar shoes with a white knight design on the tongues.

=== As Carapace ===
[[File:Carapace_Transformation_(41).png|thumb|left|Nino transforming into Carapace.]]
Carapace has a dark green bodysuit with a hoodie, the suit itself made with tiny hexagonal patterns resembling those on the [[Turtle Miraculous]]. The hoodie has a silver semicircle on the front, curved red-eye designs on the sides with black and golden details, and two small light green ovals below the bottom of the hood's opening. Over his eyes, Carapace wears black goggles with yellow-green lenses, and underneath the suit, he has a black collar. On his suit, he has six hexagon-shaped light green circles on his chest, and he has dark gray hexagon-shaped protective pads on his shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees. The Turtle Miraculous bracelet is on his right wrist. Also, Carapace wears dark green boots with an indent between his big toe and other toes, dark gray outsoles, and two indents on two sides of each boot. On his back, he carries a [[shield]] that is dark green on one side and light green on the other.

=== As Shell Shock ===
Shell Shock still has the same appearance as his hero counterpart but his outfit is scarlet, due to him having been taken over by a scarlet akuma. His appearance resulting from a normal akuma is unknown.

=== As Bubbler ===
Bubbler has light blue skin, reddish-brown eyes, and black circles around his eyes, along with a black spot above his left eye and a black spot below his right eye. He wears a bright red, blue and yellow bodysuit, with many parts of the suit being rounded like attached bubbles. Around his head, he has a red helmet that features a red antenna on top with a red sphere. Also, he wears black boots, black elbow-length gloves with pink knuckles, and black pants. On his chest, an eye-like black and white circle with two dark gray tubes attached. The tubes connect to Bubbler's red, yellow, and blue bubble container, where he puts his bubble wand when he isn't using it. The bubble wand has a blue handle and a yellow head with a long, oval hole.

=== As Oblivio ===
Oblivio is a purple humanoid with no face who has a laser cannon in its left hand and wears a gray glove in its right hand.

{{For2|more of Nino's outfits and designs|Nino Lahiffe/Designs}}

== Personality ==
[[File:OR-2 (985).png|thumb|Nino giving supportive advice to Adrien.]]
Nino is fun-loving, enthusiastic, friendly, and compassionate. He enjoys being a DJ at parties and hanging out with friends. He is described as &quot;a caring friend with a strong sense of right and wrong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miraculousladybug.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Noticing when someone, like Adrien, is upset, he does what he can to comfort them or cheer them up. If he has a vision for something, he stays dedicated to it, sometimes rather stubbornly. But if things don't go in the fashion he wants them to, it exasperates and upsets him. He is more than willing to argue his point, though he is able to change his opinions on situations or particular people. Nino becomes frustrated if he sees something that he considers unfair, like when Adrien's father won't allow Adrien to have a birthday party. However, he doesn't hold grudges for long, and whether by choice or not, he will help others when they ask for it.

[[File:TB_Nino_bubbles.jpeg|thumb|left|Nino is frustrated when Adrien’s father won’t let him have a birthday party.]]
However, he tends to act nervous in certain situations seen in &quot;Animan&quot;, when he tried to ask Marinette on a date and when he stuttered at the sight of being posted on Alya's Ladyblog. He also has some knowledge on how things work in certain situations like in &quot;Horrificator&quot; or &quot;Anansi&quot;.

Like Alya, he can be caught up in the moment or excitement of things. However, unlike Alya, he can calm himself down enough to realize reality as he doesn't hesitate on returning the Turtle Miraculous.

[[File:AS_(497).png|thumb|Nino bravely faces Anansi.]]
When it comes those he cares about he is brave and loyal refusing to leave them behind in &quot;Simon Says&quot;, where he didn't want to leave without Adrien. In &quot;[[Anansi]]&quot;, when he was even willing to fight against the titular villain to save Alya or staying with her when she's infected in &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot;. He can become doubtful of his abilities at times but takes advice from others very well.

Also, he seems to be very attached to his signature red cap, as seen in &quot;[[Chameleon]]&quot;, when it is taken from him by the titular villain and Alya is later seen reassuring him that he looks fine without it.

[[File:AS_(745).png|thumb|left|Carapace protects Alya.]]
As Carapace, most of Nino's personality remains the same like his willingness to help others and bravery although he forgets to speak in a formal manner calling the heroine dude or dudette instead of Ladybug. According to one of Alya's Instagram photos, he is also a bit camera shy.

As Bubbler, he becomes less caring and more aggressive, being much wilder and louder than normal. Although one of his intentions is to let Adrien have the birthday party that he never gets, he also despises adults and uses his powers to get rid of them. His hatred can extend to his peers if they defy his orders. As Bubbler, if anyone doesn't listen to him, they get trapped in a bubble. His rage proves to even be an issue for Hawk Moth when he traps Ladybug and Cat Noir and sends them into the sky instead of taking their [[Miraculouses]].

As Shell Shock, his personality as Carapace seems to inverse, making him cruel and aggressive.

As Oblivio, he and Alya become incredibly arrogant and conceited in their own abilities, erasing people's memories on a whim and taunting Ladybug and Cat Noir constantly after doing the same thing to them. However, they are easily frustrated as well, growing more and more angry while trying and failing to track down Ladybug and Cat Noir after they detransform.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
[[File:SS_(132).png|thumb|Nino DJing on ''The Challenge''.]]
Nino is a skilled DJ, competing with his abilities and making it to the second round of [[The Challenge|''The Challenge'']]. With his cellphone, he likes to record videos, and, in &quot;[[Horrificator]]&quot;, he films a movie with it. He is also knowledgeable in film tropes and film crew, noting how cell phones don't usually work in horror movies in &quot;Horrificator&quot; and mentioning Hollywood director Steven Basielberg in &quot;[[Volpina]]&quot;.

In &quot;[[Anansi]]&quot;, Nino has shown to have decent fighting abilities.

=== As Carapace ===
[[File:Shell-ter_Sequence_(11).png|thumb|left|Carapace’s shield.]]
Carapace has much more enhanced skills, such as speed, agility, and strength, and he is almost invulnerable to physical damage.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/660372597926993920&lt;/ref&gt; However, he doesn't seem to be able to reach great heights as other Miraculouses allow (such as Ladybug with her yo-yo, or Rena Rouge with her superior agility), having to rely on his allies for being transported long distances. He possesses a [[shield]] as a [[Miraculous tools|weapon]] that can easily be thrown and used to fight, and is strong enough to endure hits from powerful villains like Anansi.

His special power, [[Shell-ter]], is executed through his shield, and allows to create a giant green shell-like spherical barrier/force field to protect himself and his allies, and is also able to damage particular surfaces (such as Anansi's webs). Despite the usefulness of this power, it must be used wisely, as Carapace can only use it once before reverting to his civilian form five minutes after using it.

=== As Shell Shock ===
He still has the same abilities as Carapace.

=== As Bubbler ===
[[File:TB_firing_red_bubble.jpeg|thumb|Bubbler launches his bubbles at Ladybug and Cat Noir.]]
With his bubble wand weapon, Bubbler can create giant impenetrable bubbles with various powers and colors.
* Purple bubbles can be used to chase and capture people, turning green. Additionally, Bubbler can use them to project his face and give a message, and he can stand on them to levitate.
* Red bubbles are his offensive attack: he can throw them at his enemies, causing a fiery explosion on impact. Additionally, Bubbler can turn existing red bubbles into swarming green ones that attach to people and morph into a giant green bubble. This is used to catch both Ladybug and Cat Noir in one go.

He is unable to levitate in mid-air without standing on a bubble, but he can jump very high and can fly from one place to another leaving a trail of purple bubbles.

His bubbles can't be penetrated by limbs or by Ladybug's [[yo-yo]]. However, the shields Ladybug and Cat Noir create by rotating their weapons do offer some protection. Additionally, the bubbles can be blown away by air currents and can be burst by [[Cataclysm]] and the [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]].

=== As Oblivio ===
Oblivio has super strength and wields a laser cannon that can fire a blast of purple energy that causes whoever it hits to lose their memories.

== Trivia ==
* Nino aspires to be a film director hinted in the episode “Horrificator” and in “Volpina” when he says “Lila knows all of the Hollywood directors, she promised she'd mention me to Steven Basielberg himself!&quot;
* Nino is a DJ during his spare time, and he manages the school radio station.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://miraculeusecoccinelle.tumblr.com/post/135761926811/character-descriptions-of-the-cast-of-miraculous&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://miraculeusecoccinelle.tumblr.com/post/129733355946/miraculous-les-aventures-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the French version, Nino's villain name is Le Bulleur.
** In the English version of &quot;The Bubbler&quot;, Nino is only referred to as ''the Bubbler'' by [[Tikki]] while everyone else calls him ''Bubbler''.
* An earlier concept design for Nino involved a white shirt with red color included in the eye logo and dark gray headphones.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Old Classroom Photo concept.png|Image]] from the [https://youtu.be/qpDCWD5G2jU 2014 Licensing Show Video].&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Thomas BD2017 5.jpg|thumb|Alya and Nino sharing his headphones in a painting by Thomas Astruc.]]
* In &quot;The Bubbler&quot;, Nino has black hair, but in all episodes afterward, he has brown hair.
* Nino sits next to Adrien and in front of Alya in class.
* Nino's family comes from Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;http://princessofharte.tumblr.com/post/141454553764/i-felt-like-i-had-to-share-this-with-someone-nino Submitted to admin Princess of Harte from a private ask on Tumblr.&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously assumed his family came from Réunion based on a series of tweets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/654561885828857856 Here] Thomas Astruc said that either Alya or Nino's family comes from Réunion and [https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/686177738521227264 here] he revealed that Alya's comes from Martinique.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the online game ''Miraculous Mission Ladybug'', Bubbler is the enemy, but he is colored blue and appears multiple times throughout the game.
** Also, in ''Ladybug Contra os Vilões'', he is the enemy, this time with the right colors.
* In [[Season 2]] and upcoming comics, Nino will have more interactions with Alya.&lt;ref&gt;http://whatitdobugaboo.tumblr.com/post/147862332334/thomas-confirmed-there-will-be-more-alya-x-nino&lt;/ref&gt;
*Nino's name is a wordplay on &quot;No life&quot; - or rather, ''[[wikipedia:Nolife (TV channel)|Nolife]]'' -&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/983092083878658050 Thomas Astruc on Twitter] 8 April 2018&lt;br&gt;''&quot;Un dernier #MonSouvenirNolife sous forme d'easter egg qui ne sera plus compris que par une poignée d'anciens désormais: Dans Miraculous, le nom de Famille de Nino, le pote geek d'Adrien, c'est Lahiffe. #TheEndofNolife&quot;''&lt;br&gt;(Translation: One last #MyNolifeMemory in the form of easter egg that won't be understood more than by a handful of elders from now on: In Miraculous, the family name of Nino, Adrien's geek buddy, is Lahiffe. #TheEndofNolife)&lt;/ref&gt; a French TV network about pop culture, self-described as ''&quot;for geeks, nerds and otakus&quot;''. This refers to his geeky personality.
* ''Carapace'' means &quot;a protective shell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carapace&lt;/ref&gt;
**It is also the technical name for a turtle's backshell.
* Both Carapace and his civilian identity were revealed on August 31, 2017, in a press release video from French ''Miraculous'' distributor TFOU.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
* Following Alya Césaire, Nino is the second person to become a Miraculous holder and an akumatized villain, excluding Gabriel, who akumatized himself.
* His transformation sequence seems to have been inspired by part of the opening credits of the 1987 version of ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'', where Michelangelo spins on his shell while break-dancing, a move emulated by Nino.
* Ironic as much his villain name came from a turtle-themed monster named [[w:c:powerrangers:Shellshock|Shellshock]] from ''Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers''.
* The orange markings on the side of Carapace's hood are likely based on the red-eared slider.
** Coincidentally, this is the species of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
*When Nino and Alya become Oblivio, their supervillain name is a pun on the word oblivious.
* At Comic-Con 2019, Marinette, Adrien, Alya, and Chloé were announced to have real-world Instagram accounts that fans could follow. In the video showing the accounts, Nino was shown to be tagged in a picture with a supposed account of his own, under the account name &quot;@djnino&quot; – currently, however, there exists an inactive account under that same nickname. While it is currently unknown if Nino will get an Instagram account in the future, Alya started the trending hashtag [https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/ninoneedsaninstagram/ #ninoneedsaninstagram], which the accounts use to &quot;tag&quot; him in posts.

{{Quote|Music is often simpler than words.|Luka|&quot;[[Captain Hardrock]]&quot;|quotelink = yes}}{{SpoilerButton}}
'''Luka Couffaine''' is a character who appears in the [[Season 2|second season]] of ''[[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]''. He is the older brother of [[Juleka Couffaine]] and a new student at [[Collège Françoise Dupont]], who attracts the attention of [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;http://tvmag.lefigaro.fr/programme-tv/miraculous-les-secrets-de-la-saison-2-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir_d32cc720-a2c3-11e7-b619-f944cd28c6f6/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://adala-news.fr/2017/09/le-plein-dinformations-sur-lanime-miraculous-ladybug-saison-2/ (translated by Tumblr fan [http://official-ladyblog.tumblr.com/post/165848228570/season-2-synopsis-leak official-ladybug])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;O Universo da TV&quot;&gt;http://www.ouniversodatv.com/2017/10/gloob-estreia-novos-episodios-de.html#axzz4ukj8DxGx&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[Silencer]]&quot;, when [[Bob Roth]] threatens Marinette after she accuses him of stealing [[Kitty Section]]'s idea for [[XY]]'s new song, he is akumatized by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Silencer''', a voice-stealing supervillain.

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;[[Desperada]]&quot;, after [[Adrien Agreste]] gives up being Aspik for not being able to help Ladybug against the titular villain, she gives Luka the [[Snake Miraculous]]. When the Miraculous is inhabited by [[Sass]], he becomes '''Viperion''', a snake-themed superhero who helps Ladybug and Cat Noir during &quot;particularly difficult missions&quot; in [[Season 3]].}}

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Luka has medium-length black hair that has dyed teal blue tips, light blue aqua eyes, pale pink lips and a Roman nose.

=== Civilian attire ===
His attire includes a white shirt with a black [[Jagged Stone]] imprint and black jeans ripped at the knee. He also wears a brown leather bracelet, yellow and orange wristbands, and his fingernails are painted black. He has a sky blue jacket with a navy blue hoodie underneath, as well as black high top converse with multi-colored splotches. He wears a black ring with silver outlining on his left pointer finger and black gauges in his ears.

=== As Silencer ===
He has blue skin and he wears a pink, black and yellow-ish outfit with a jagged mouth on his helmet.

=== As Viperion ===
He wears a black and cyan suit, appearing to be slender and muscular. His suit has a snake texture along with the same kind of underbelly like a snake and has cyan colored mask around his eyes. His eyes also change from aqua to green as does his hair highlights. His [[Lyre|weapon]] appears to be a lyre.

== Personality ==
[[File:CH_(247).png|thumb|left|Luka explains that he tends to make more sense with his guitar.]]Unlike [[Juleka Couffaine|Juleka]], Luka is a calm boy who has a mixed personality of being playful, charming, mature and flirtatious. He is skilled at reading people's emotions and expressing it through music.

Luka is very kind and generous, especially towards [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] by cheering her up in &quot;[[Captain Hardrock]]&quot;. In the episode &quot;[[Frozer]]&quot;, Luka seems to be a easygoing and relaxed boy as he kindly helps Marinette tie her laces on her figure skates and doesn't react when she kisses him on the cheek.

However, in &quot;[[Silencer]]&quot;, Luka shows that sometimes he can lose his calm, happening when he feels that he and mainly his friends are being wronged, like when [[Bob Roth]] stole [[Kitty Section]]'s music, dance and outfits and claimed them to be [[XY]]'s. Despite everything, he tries to retain his cool, only getting really mad when Bob threatened Marinette.

{{HideSpoiler|Like Adrien, he's also supportive and encouraging towards others like his sister Juleka in &quot;Reflekdoll&quot;. Adrien describes him as brave, caring and determined.}}

As Viperion, most of Luka's personality remains the same like his caring and helpfulness as he tried to save Carapace by taking [[Wayhem|Party Crasher]]'s attacks. {{HideSpoiler|He also is calm, focused, observant and he's not afraid to give suggestions or ideas to others.}}

As Silencer, his main goal is to make Bob Roth tell the truth regarding the fact he stole the [[Kitty Section]]'s song as he takes the voices of anyone that could serve his purposes or get in his way. However, he still retains his care and love for Marinette, as she was the only person whose voice he spared and he reassured her he would make &quot;justice&quot; for her and Kitty Section.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Luka is excellent at playing his guitar and creating melodies through people's emotions. In &quot;Frozer&quot;, he is also good at ice skating and fairly strong as he can lift Marinette with ease.

=== As Silencer ===
Silencer can steal people's voices by touching their lips with his two fingers and making a shushing motion; the voice will then escape from the person as a jellyfish-like entity. Once their voices are out, he can store them inside his mask and then he can talk with them using his hands. If his power is used on a Miraculous holder, he can render them virtually powerless unless he says the invocations in their place.

=== As Viperion ===
Viperion has much more enhanced skills, such as speed, agility, and strength, and he is almost invulnerable to physical damage. Like a snake, he also has enhanced senses like hearing and smell as well as infrared vision and possibly the ability to feel vibrations but it is yet to be seen.

His special power, [[Second Chance]], allows him to reverse time and change the outcome of an event, in which the power activates by sliding his finger on his Miraculous. He is able to go back to the first moment he activated his power as many times as he wants before the snake's head returns to it's original position. 

== Relationships ==
=== [[Juleka Couffaine]] ===
Juleka is Luka's younger sister. They are very close with one another, and are also a part of the same band, Kitty Section.

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;Reflekdoll&quot;, more of their relationship is seen, as Juleka has told Luka her desire to model Marinette's designs and how insecure she was in asking her and doing it. Luka has shown to be very understanding towards her dreams and fears and is also encouraging, as he encouraged her to ask Marinette to be her model.}}

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:CH_(260).png|thumb|left|Luka playing his guitar for Marinette.]]
Marinette and Luka first meet in &quot;[[Captain Hardrock]]&quot; and Luka falls in love with her at first sight.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Winny_BayDay/status/1060158383221805056&lt;/ref&gt; His mother sends her down to go get him to rehearse with the band. Marinette, who is still bothered by Adrien not coming, and not knowing who Luka is or what he looks like, is startled by him as he opens his eyes, and starts to stutter and mix up her words. He simply teases her playfully about her stuttering but immediately regrets it when she frowns, embarrassed. Reacting to her frown, he apologizes and begins to play his guitar. Her warming up to him as she listens to him play the guitar, he believes that music is &quot;often simpler than words&quot;. As a memento, he lets her keep a guitar pick of Jagged Stone that she admires, leaves her in thought, calling her a &quot;funny girl&quot; with a sweet hidden smile. Luka and Marinette exchange sweet glances to each other when [[Alya Césaire]] notices Marinette's interest in Luka immediately and teases her about it. He compliments Marinette throughout the time he has with her, helps her escape and hide, and is also worried about her when he talks to Ladybug. Finding out Marinette is safe he calls her &quot;unbelievably brave&quot;, and Marinette, as Ladybug, blushes at his comment. Luka spends time with her in &quot;[[Frozer]]&quot; when she begins to doubt her relationship pursues of [[Adrien Agreste]] offering her support while at the ice rink. Afterwards he isn't fazed when Marinette thanks him by kissing him on the cheek.

In &quot;Silencer&quot;, his care for Marinette is so strong that when he witnesses [[Bob Roth]] threaten her, he gets angry enough to be prone to akumatization. Even as Silencer, he retains his care for her, sparing her voice and promising to bring justice for her and Kitty Section.

{{HideSpoiler|He spends more time with her in &quot;Desperada&quot;, where he teaches her to play his guitar.}}

[[File:CH (796).png|thumb|Ladybug blushes at Luka's comment.]]
Luka appears to respect Ladybug. When Ladybug unties him in &quot;Captain Hardrock&quot;, he asks her about Marinette, to which Ladybug tells him that she's safe and was the one who alerted her to the situation. In &quot;[[Mayura]]&quot;, he participates in the Parisian rebellion in order to help Ladybug and Cat Noir in defeating Hawk Moth.

{{HideSpoiler|During &quot;Desperada&quot;, he was very brave to help Ladybug escape from the titular villain receiving her thanks. Under Adrien's recommendation, he was given the Snake Miraculous by her.}}
As Viperion, like the other heroes on the team he follows Ladybug's lead without question.

{{HideSpoiler|Calmly observing the situation he was opened to giving the heroine his ideas and helped his allies devise a plan to defeat Desperada.}}

However, as Silencer, he gets annoyed with Ladybug interfering with his plans and has no qualms about taking her voice away.

=== [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien Agreste/Cat Noir]] ===
[[File:CH_(1070).png|thumb|left|Luka helps Adrien up.]]
Luka doesn't know Adrien too well, but when he meets Adrien in &quot;Captain Hardrock&quot;, Luka welcomes him into the band. In &quot;Frozer&quot;, Luka notices that Marinette seems to have feelings for Adrien and advises her to talk to him. He also attends Adrien's boys only party and helps clean up the mess after it in &quot;Party Crasher&quot;.

{{HideSpoiler|He does his best to keep Adrien hidden from the titular villain after awhile, he got worried about him and was relieved that he was found. Seeing that Adrien wasn't the right choice for the jewel, Luka took his recommendation of using the Snake Miraculous wondering what he missed. After Desperada's defeat the two were playing music together.}}

Despite not meeting Cat Noir in person like Ladybug he appears to respect the hero and takes in the Paris Rebellion showing his support towards him in &quot;Mayura&quot;.

He also works alongside the hero following his lead in battling the party villain.
{{HideSpoiler|As his alter ego Viperion in &quot;Desperada&quot;, he meets Cat Noir for the first time and the two get along very well and was open to giving him his ideas.}}

As Silencer, he gets annoyed with Cat Noir interfering with his plans and has no qualms about taking his voice away.

=== [[Bob Roth]] ===
When Bob steals [[Kitty Section]]'s idea for XY's new song, Luka goes along with [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] to angrily confront him. Though he attempts to retain his cool, upon witnessing Bob threaten Marinette, he becomes so angry that he gets akumatized. As Silencer, his main goal is to force Bob to admit that he stole Kitty Section's idea on live TV.

=== [[Nino Lahiffe|Nino Lahiffe/Carapace]] ===
Luka doesn't know Nino too well, even though they are both into music, as well as Luka attending the boys only party Nino put together for Adrien, and had stayed behind to help him and the others clear the &quot;aftermath&quot; of it in &quot;Party Crasher&quot;.

As their alter egos, Viperion uses his marked position of [[Second Chance]] so he could go back in time to prevent Carapace from getting captured by Party Crasher.

=== [[Max Kanté|Max Kanté/Pegasus]] ===
Luka doesn't know Max too well, even though Luka later attended the boys only party that Max and a small number of his friends helped Nino put together for Adrien, and had stayed behind to help them clear the &quot;aftermath&quot; of it in &quot;Party Crasher&quot;.

As their alter egos, Viperion and Pegasus fight beside each other as a team, with Ladybug, Cat Noir and the rest of their Miraculous holder allies. Pegasus shows concern for Viperion when he gets captured by Party Crasher.

=== [[Lê Chiến Kim|Lê Chiến Kim/King Monkey]] ===
Luka doesn't know Kim too well, even though Luka later attended the boys only party that Kim and a small number of his friends helped Nino put together for Adrien, and had stayed behind to help them clear the &quot;aftermath&quot; of it in &quot;Party Crasher&quot;.

As their alter egos, Viperion and King Monkey fight beside each other as a team, with Ladybug, Cat Noir and the rest of their Miraculous holder allies.

== Trivia ==
{{SpoilerButton}}
* The name '''Luka''' means &quot;light&quot; in Latin. 
** In the Russian dub, his name is changed to '''Luke'''. 
* Luka's surname '''Couffaine''' is a combination of &quot;couffin&quot; (French for &quot;coffin&quot;) and the French suffix &quot;-aine&quot; (meaning &quot;of or from a place&quot;), ultimately meaning &quot;of/from the coffin&quot;.
* Luka was first revealed in a French synopsis for Season 2 on Le Figaro.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
** He was later revealed to be [[Juleka Couffaine]]'s older brother in a Brazilian synopsis for Season 2 on O Universo da TV.&lt;ref name=&quot;O Universo da TV&quot; /&gt;
*** According to [[Thomas Astruc]], Luka is approximately two years older than Juleka. &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/981480463243055105&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to [[Feri González]], Luka is a handsome boy and people &quot;are going to fall in love with him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/916773746941267968&lt;/ref&gt;
** She also noted that both Luka and [[Kagami Tsurugi]] are &quot;charming, rounded characters&quot; who are not limited to roles as alternate love interests.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/dAFerisae/status/917205120462471168&lt;/ref&gt;
* All the Couffaine's names so far end with '''-ka'''.
** However, it is actually a pun, as a matter of fact in French it sounds like &quot;acouphène&quot; which means &quot;tinnitus&quot;.
* Viperion was first revealed in concept art shown at the 2018 Comic Con Experience panel on December 6, 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccxp18&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousINTL/status/1070793485802827776&lt;/ref&gt;
* Viperion's name is likely a portmanteau of ''viper'' (a family of venomous snakes) and ''Hyperion,'' a Titan of Greek mythology associated with the sun and daytime.
**In Greek mythology, the priestess of the oracle at Delphi was known as Pythia, stemming from the giant snake slain by Apollo (another god of the sun) &quot;in the strength of Hyperion (day).&quot;
*** Apollo is also known to have a lyre.
{{HideSpoiler|
* Luka is the second known character to use the Snake Miraculous by itself, the first being Adrien.
* As of &quot;Desperada&quot;, Luka is the eighth person to become an akumatized villain and a Miraculous holder, excluding [[Gabriel Agreste]], who akumatized himself.
* In &quot;Desperada&quot;, he claims to have been playing the guitar since he was a baby.}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an upcoming form of [[Adrien Agreste]] transformed with the [[Cat Miraculous]] and [[Snake Miraculous]].

== Appearance==
Snake Noir is a hybrid form of Cat Noir and  Aspik. He has a black suit with turquoise parts.

== Abilities ==
It's unknown what Snake Noir's full abilities are but he has the powers of both [[Cataclysm]] and [[Second Chance]]. 

== Trivia ==
* Snake Noir was first revealed in concept art shown at the 2018 Comic Con Experience panel on December 6, 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccxp18&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousINTL/status/1070793485802827776&lt;/ref&gt;
* Snake Noir's name translates to &quot;Black Snake&quot;.
** If Snake Noir follows the same naming convention as Aspik, the name may be a reference to the genus ''Walterinnesia aegyptia''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walterinnesia_aegyptia], which contains two species of venomous black snakes found exclusively in the Middle East.

'''Thomas Astruc''' is a director introduced in the [[Season 3|third season]] of ''[[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]''. He is played by and based off [[Thomas Astruc]], the creator of ''Miraculous''.&lt;ref&gt;20 September 2016:
https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/778296186528796672 &quot;Had to discard a S2 script because wasn't satisfying enough. So we wrote another. Guess who's gonna be akumatized?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/778299928162529280 &quot;Replying to @Thomas_Astruc #cameo&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
(both tweets by Astruc included a close-up photo of his face)
&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[Animaestro]]&quot;, when Thomas' special night is ruined at his [[Les aventures de Ladybug et Chat Noir|movie]] premiere and no one cares about him for creating his animated movie about [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]], he is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Animaestro''', an animated [[Akumatized villains|supervillain]].

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
He is a rather corpulent man with green eyes, black hair and a beard.

=== Civilian attire ===
He is wearing black pants and a black shirt, over which he wears a black jacket. Around his neck he wears a badge with a blue lace. 

=== As Animaestro ===
After he was akumatized, he appears as a silhouette of himself but semi-transparent with pencil-scribbles filling out his body. He also wears a Ladybug mask.

== Personality ==
He is a very nice man and usually upbeat and excited about his movie premieres. He just wants to be recognized and appreciated for his work, but has a tendency to be ignored by everyone.

As Animaestro, he is determined to show everyone what animation is capable of.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
He is the director of an animated film based on Ladybug and Cat Noir.

=== As Animaestro ===
He is able to shapeshift into whatever animated 2D creature he can imagine, so he has practically unlimited abilities, if he can think of it. But he can only move as long as he is watched by at least one person. If no one looks at him, he freezes and he will be stuck in place until someone looks at him.

== Sightings ==
{{AppearancesS3|AM=yes|PC=yes|PT2=p}}

== Trivia ==
* It can be assumed that Thomas's birth date is January 18, 1975, as his real life counterpart, who is the creator of the series, was born on this date.
* Thomas' akumatization was decided upon when he had to discard a script for Season 2 because it &quot;wasn't satisfying enough.&quot;
* Thomas' character is allergic to almonds, although he is not allergic to them in real life.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/1105519048224313347&lt;/ref&gt;
* His supervillain name is a combination of both animated and [[wikipedia:Maestro|maestro]].
*One of the forms that he transformed into was [https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Ryu Ryu] from the video game called Street fighter and a heroine from the Pretty Cure franchise.

In &quot;[[Backwarder]]&quot;, after she mistakenly thinks Fu doesn't love her anymore and it's too late to reunite, she is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Backwarder''', a time stealing villain who wants to recover lost time.&lt;ref name=&quot;:MLBS3 RTS FRCH&quot;&gt;RTS Deux released a list of all the information of the Season 3 episodes on their [https://bit.ly/2TraPvu website] which can also be found [https://bit.ly/2D86whR here] and [https://bit.ly/2S4Nu6e here.] The individual image of the list can also be found [[:File:MLBS3 EP List - RTSDEUX.png|here]]. [[Feri González]] also corroborated the authenticity of the list [https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/1091484996383227905 here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Marianne is petite with green eyes and grey hair that is tied in a bun. 

=== Civilian attire ===
As a civilian, Marianne wears a yellow buttoned collar shirt with a tan trench coat. She wears a yellow brooch with 愛 (love) on it, given to her by Fu on her shirt.

=== As Backwarder ===
Backwarder has pale purple skin with yellow eyes and light lilac-colored lipstick. Her helmet is black and teardrop-shaped, with a yellow circle in the center of each side (not including the front or back), a large yellow key resembling that of a wind-up toy on top, and an upside down teardrop-shaped pale purple face mask with holes for her eyes and mouth, a small nose, two black dots beneath each eye hole, and a golden heart on the forehead, resembling a porcelain doll's face. Each time an object is touched with her sword, one of the cracks on the face of her helmet disappears. The main body of her costume is yellow and black, with a rounded shape resembling a clockwork doll. Her chest has a stylized clock face on the front where her akuma lies, with her brooch acting as the dial. On each of her shoulders, there is a yellow spherical pauldron. Her arms are mostly black, with accenting yellow &quot;gloves&quot; with scalloped ends. Her cane has also been transformed into a black sword with a golden tip resembling a clock hand, which she uses to activate her powers.

== Personality ==
Marianne is a strongly nostalgic person as she desires to repeat the past and make up for her lost time with Wang Fu. She is also shown to be a very brave and heroic person, as she was not afraid to stay in a Paris under siege during World War II and help fight back with the resistance, allowing Fu time to escape with the [[Miracle Box]]. She's confident and patient, and was prepared to confess her feelings to Fu without hesitation, waiting years for him to be ready to come to her, while she continually came to the same spot in Paris, and being heartbroken when she thought that he could no longer love her.

As Backwarder, she becomes quite aggressive and ruthless. She has no qualms using her powers on civilians and bystanders, despite the danger it might put them, as shown when she reversed a car and a woman with her stroller, causing the two to almost collide. She is also strategic and clever, understanding that using her power she can force Ladybug to lead her back to Fu and the Miracle Box. Similar to how she was as Marianne, she desires to reverse her age in order to make up for her lost time with Wang Fu. However as Backwarder, she is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this goal. She displays a large amount of confidence in her abilities, which led to her downfall, as she ignored Cat Noir once she had made him go backwards, deeming him no longer a threat and choosing to go after Ladybug instead, unaware this was Ladybug's plan from the beginning.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
TBA

=== As Backwarder ===
Backwarder has great speed, strength and agility, allowing her to leap great distances, as shown when she jumps to the top of a Ferris wheel with minimal effort. Wielding her clock hand sword, anything that is touched by the tip of the sword begins to move and talk backwards in time, repeating their earlier actions. She uses this ability to grow stronger with every tap and redirect attacks. However it seems that she cannot stop the things that she touches from going back in time, even if she didn't intend to use her power on them, as shown when Ladybug pushes her into a trash can to save Cat Noir. Tripping her up and accidentally causing her to tap the trash can, causing all the trash to fly back out at her.

== Trivia ==
* Marianne was introduced in a synopsis that was released the show's Switzerland TV broadcaster, RTS Deux.&lt;ref name=&quot;:MLBS3 RTS FRCH&quot; /&gt;
* Marianne is likely around the same age as Wang Fu, possibly making her the oldest known akumatized villain shown in the series.
* Her name is an homage to the grandmother of [[Fred Lenoir]], a writer for the show. Marianne's character is also a reference to his grandmother, who was a resistance member during a war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:Marianne Lenoir (Thomas' Twitter)&quot; /&gt;
* For reasons unknown, Marianne is aware of the Miraculouses, the Miracle Box, and Fu's duty as the Guardian.
** It's likely that Fu trusts her deeply, hence revealing his secrets.
** It is also possible that Marianne was a former Miraculous holder, as she asked for the [[Ladybug Miraculous]] in the past.
* She is the second akumatized villain with time related powers, the first being [[Alix Kubdel|Timebreaker]].
** Coincidentally, both were indirectly made vulnerable to akumatization by Marinette while she tried to juggle three things at the same time: supporting her friends, fulfilling a task by an adult, and spending time with Adrien.

{{Quote|He who hopes give himself the opportunity to obtain what he desires. But he who fears, always ends up with the very thing he dreads.|Tomoe Tsurugi [[Backwarder]]&quot;}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/1105581493559193601&lt;/ref&gt; is a world champion in fencing and the mother of [[Kagami Tsurugi]]. 

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;[[Ikari Gozen]]&quot;, after Kagami disobeys her by choosing to participate in the Friendship Day games against her will, Tomoe is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] into '''Ikari Gozen''', a centaur samurai themed villain in order to punish her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;RTS Deux released a list of all the information of the Season 3 episodes on their [https://bit.ly/2TraPvu website] which can also be found [https://bit.ly/2D86whR here] and [https://bit.ly/2S4Nu6e here.] The individual image of the list can also be found [[:File:MLBS3 EP List - RTSDEUX.png|here]]. [[Feri González]] also corroborated the authenticity of the list [https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/1091484996383227905 here.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Tomoe is a pale-skinned slender Japanese woman of average height with long dark blue hair that is arranged in Chignon style, which is held with a red clip.

=== Civilian attire ===
Tomoe wears a white shirt, long red pants, black sunglasses and she uses a [[Wikipedia:Bokken|bokken]] as a support cane for her blindness. 

{{HideSpoiler|
=== As Ikari Gozen ===
As Ikari Gozen, Tomoe has an appearance reminiscent of a [[Wikipedia:Centaur|classical Greek centaur]] as her lower body resembles a horse, complete with hooves and four legs. As a living suit of hollow samurai armor, her skin is the same metallic red as the rest of her body with pupiless yellow eyes, partially covered with a helmet reminiscent of the one that [[Kagami Tsurugi|Riposte]] bears, albeit with a large horn instead of a winged emblem and bearing the Tsurugi family crest on her chest. Because the Tsurugi's car was transformed along with Tomoe in the akumatization, she appears to be very mechanical and vehicular, especially in the lower half of her body. It's appearance evokes a high end car, with tires at the joints, headlights at the front where it exhaust ports throughout and Ikari Gozen wields her akumatized [[Wikipedia:Bokken|bokken]] in her right hand.}} 


== Personality ==
Tomoe seems to be a very strict and kept person who is very aware of her environment. She can be wise and informative towards others as well, advising [[Gabriel Agreste]] to not give into fear in &quot;[[Backwarder]]&quot;.

{{HideSpoiler|When she mentions [[Gabriel Agreste]] being more blind than she is, Tomoe has a more opened mind and she doesn't always believe in friendship as she believes forging bonds with another can end sour or disappointing, but she was willing to change her ways in letting [[Kagami Tsurugi]] make a new friend.

As Ikari Gozen, Tomoe becomes much more aggressive and violent as she regularly performs large sword strokes without care for collateral damage and knocking aside several cars. Her aggression is so that she shows no hesitation to anything, even combating [[Kagami Tsurugi|her own daughter]], as she attempts to stomp her several times under her hooves. She believes she is well within her rights as a mother to act out and punish her daughter as she deems fit for disobeying her. She is also rather confident and prideful, declaring herself &quot;as swift as the wind, as powerful as the flood, as quick as lightning.&quot;}}

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Tomoe is a very skilled champion in fencing that she is able to sense the mood of those near her even though she is blind.

{{HideSpoiler|
=== As Ikari Gozen ===
As Ikari Gozen, Tomoe has an incredible size as she rivals even some of the largest villains like [[André Glacier|Glaciator]] or [[August|Gigantitan]]. With this strength, she is able to knock aside large heavy objects like cars with ease and create large heavy stomps with her hooves, all while still being rather nimble and dexterous, able to gallop, leap large distances and wield her sword with one hand. On her akumatized form, it would also appear that she is able to see well.

Using her strength and size, Ikari Gozen is able to easily able to grab ordinarily sized people like [[Kagami Tsurugi]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] in order to swallow them and trap them inside her body. The cage inside her body still heavily resembles the car it was made from, complete with seats and seat belts that she can freely manipulate, as shown when she was able to restrict Cat Noir's hand when he was about to use [[Cataclysm]].}}

{{Master Fu Quote}}
'''Master {{PAGENAME}}''' (Chinese:王富 Wáng Fù) or  '''Master Fu Wang''' (in western order) is a healer, the Great Guardian of the [[Miraculouses]] and the last known remaining guardian from the [[Order of the Guardians]]. He gives [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] and [[Adrien Agreste]] their Miraculouses to stop [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and his [[Akumatized villains|villains]]' evil-doings. With the [[Turtle Miraculous]], when inhabited by [[Wayzz]], Master Fu transforms into a turtle-themed superhero. In the series, he has never actually turned into superhero form despite being a Miraculous holder with a kwami. 

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Master Fu or Wang Fu is a short Chinese man with dark brown eyes. His hair is gray and he has a mustache and goatee.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears a red Hawaiian shirt with a white hibiscus flower pattern, tan capri pants, dark brown shoes, and the Turtle Miraculous on his right wrist.

{{For2|more of Wang Fu's outfits and designs|Wang Fu/Designs}}

== Personality ==
Master Fu is a wise, gentle, and respectful man who is dedicated to keeping Miraculouses out of the wrong hands to maintain balance, and he recognizes good heroes as kind, helpful individuals who put others before themselves. While he is serious when it comes to his work as a healer and a guardian, Master Fu can also be lighthearted, often slightly teasing Marinette. He doesn't consider himself old as believes that he is young, but he is still aware of when he can't fix a major issue himself.

Because of his mistake, he is very careful about handing out other Miraculouses to the right people. Also, he prefers to keep himself and his purpose a secret from Hawk Moth and other people, aware that Hawk Moth may come after him or the Miraculouses in the box if he finds out about him. Usually, he does not allow people whom he has given Miraculous to meet him unless there is a special reason.

Master Fu can get angry with those who go behind his back or doesn't ask for his permission on occasion but he also forgiving towards those who admit their mistake.

In &quot;[[Backwarder]]&quot;, according to Marinette, Master Fu has a bit of a forgetful memory, like when he lost his keys, most likely owing to his old age. He is also aware he won't be around forever so, as a part of a backup plan, he wants to have Marinette be the next guardian of the Miracle Box, showing his tactful and clever side.

Like Marinette as Ladybug, Wang Fu is known to be cautious and careful knowing it wasn't a wise idea to rush into fight without help seen in &quot;Party Crasher&quot;.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
[[File:Princess Fragrance 839.png|thumb|188px|Master Fu reading Tikki's energies.]]
As a healer, Master Fu can improve the health and read the energies of humans and [[kwamis]]. One of his methods includes hitting a gong, as seen when he helps [[Tikki]] heal from her sickness in &quot;[[Princess Fragrance]]&quot;.

Additionally, Master Fu is very knowledgeable about the history of the kwamis and the Miraculouses. He explains with strong clarity and insight how kwamis are abstract creatures, how they are formed, the types of abstract ideas and emotions that they are formed from to [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] in the [[Miraculous Adventures Issue 2|second issue]] of ''[[Miraculous Adventures]]''.

As he explains in &quot;[[The Collector]]&quot;, he was trained by the [[Order of the Guardians]], so while his training wasn't finished, he can decipher some of the code in the [[Miraculous spellbook]]. His knowledge also extends to some of the Miraculous' powers, explaining the wish-granting power of the [[Ladybug Miraculous]] and [[Cat Miraculous]] and its consequences to Marinette in &quot;[[Robostus]]&quot;. However, he acknowledges that some of his understanding of the Miraculouses and their powers is limited.

In &quot;Syren&quot;, despite his age Master Wang is very strong carrying a large container of bugs with a single hand without much struggle. He is fluent in speaking Chinese.

=== As a Miraculous holder ===
Master Fu's skills and abilities as a [[Miraculous holders|Miraculous holder]] remain unknown, as in &quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)|Ladybug &amp;amp; Cat Noir]]&quot;, he is unable to transform due to his old age giving him back pain.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Wayzz]] ===
[[File:OR1-(82).png|left|thumb|180x180px|Master Fu contemplating Wayzz's news about the Butterfly Miraculous.]]
Master Fu and Wayzz work well together, both taking the situation of a Miraculous falling into evil hands very seriously. Although Master Fu disagrees with Wayzz about being too old to defeat Hawk Moth, he agrees with him that he can't stop Hawk Moth alone.

Despite getting along with Wayzz, Master Fu can get angry at him if he does something without his permission as seen in &quot;Sandboy&quot;, but he quickly forgave him saying that he should ask next time.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]] ===
[[File:OR1-(208).png|thumb|Master Fu tries one of Marinette's macarons.]]
Master Fu chooses Marinette to wield the Ladybug Miraculous after she unknowingly passes his test by courageously rescuing him from oncoming traffic. When it comes to both her and Adrien, he believes that they are made for each other. Marinette comes to his shop so he can heal [[Tikki]] in &quot;Princess Fragrance&quot;, where he reminds her to be patient and finds amusement in that she isn't aware that he knows about kwamis and Miraculouses, asking her what kind of cat Tikki is. Wang officially reveals himself to Marinette in &quot;[[Volpina]]&quot; when she and Tikki visit him to give him the Miraculous spellbook.

[[File:Sapotis-000542.png|thumb|left|Master Fu allows Marinette to pick a trusted ally.]]
Since then, Master Fu is a patient and sage teacher to Marinette, explaining the origins of kwamis and the consequences of their powers to her. He is understanding with her when she doubts telling him the truth about who she got the book from in &quot;The Collector&quot; and she has to leave early to head to the [[Île aux Cygnes]] in ''Miraculous Adventures''. However, in &quot;The Collector&quot;, he gently notes to her that they need to trust each other in order to defeat Hawk Moth. His faith in her shows when he entrusts her to choose a one-time Miraculous holder in &quot;[[Sapotis]]&quot; as long as it is a trustworthy person and she returns the Miraculous afterwards.

During &quot;Anansi&quot; he even trusts Marinette to a point where he allowed her to use his Miraculous against the titular villain. He also knows that Marinette is sensible seen in &quot;Queen Wasp&quot;, when he saw that Chloé had the Bee Miraculous. He knew right away she wouldn't have given it to her but Master Wang had faith that Marinette would fix her mistake. In &quot;Malediktator&quot;, he was still unsure if Chloé was a good choice stating that Marinette took a big risk and yet when she spoke of how Ladybug improved her, Chloé would improve as Queen Bee with that he remained supportive of Marinette's choice. He praised her for doing a good job against Hawk Moth's army in &quot;Heroes' Day&quot;

In &quot;[[Backwarder]]&quot;, Master Fu revealed that he intends for the Miracle Box to go to Marinette when he dies and that she will become the next Guardian of the Miraculous.

=== [[Adrien Agreste]] ===
[[File:OR1-(328).png|thumb|Master Fu being helped up by Adrien.]]
Master Fu chooses Adrien to wield the Cat Miraculous after he unknowingly passes his test by helping him up when he pretended to have fallen and unable to get up himself. He believes that Adrien and Marinette are made for each other. In &quot;Sapotis&quot;, Master Fu agrees with Marinette when she points out that both she and Cat Noir have been careful to hide their secret identities and use their Miraculouses wisely.

In &quot;[[Syren]]&quot;, after deciphering the recipe that allows to unlock new powers for the Miraculous holders, and under Ladybug's advice, Wang decides that Adrien can finally be informed of the various informations of which until then he was unaware. He later begins posing as a substitute Chinese tutor so he can continue teaching Adrien about the Miraculouses. In &quot;[[Malediktator]]&quot;, Wang Fu showed great concern for Cat Noir when Marinette told him about his condition. In &quot;[[Party Crasher]]&quot;, he attends the party at Adrien's house, and later advises him as Cat Noir not to engage the [[Wayhem|titular villain]] without help, being frustrated when he doesn't listen. 

=== [[Alya Césaire]] ===
Despite not meeting Alya in person, Wang is aware that Marinette chose her to wield the Fox Miraculous seeing her as the &quot;right choice&quot;. In &quot;Syren&quot;, he continues to allow Alya to be Rena Rouge.

=== [[Nino Lahiffe]] ===
Despite not meeting Nino in person, Wang is aware that Marinette chose him to wield the Turtle Miraculous in his place. In &quot;Party Crasher&quot;, he secretly gives Nino the Turtle Miraculous in order for him to help Cat Noir.  

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois]] ===
Despite not meeting Chloé in person, Wang is aware of her selfish and immature personality, and he is certain at first that Marinette didn't choose her to wield the Bee Miraculous. In &quot;Malediktator&quot;, he was still unsure if Chloé was a good choice, stating that Marinette took a big risk by trusting her. Since Marinette believes that being a superhero may give Chloé the opportunity to become a better person, Wang agreed on that reasoning allowing her to continue acting as Queen Bee from that point on. However, even after agreeing to re-entrusting the Bee Miraculous to Chloé in &quot;[[Heroes' Day]]&quot;, he was still doubtful about Chloé as a good ally, in part because of the public knowledge of her civilian identity seen in &quot;Miraculer&quot;.

=== [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] ===
Though Master Fu hasn't met Hawk Moth in person, he's aware of his existence and has been determined to stop him and retrieve Nooroo and the Moth Miraculous. He expects that Hawk Moth wants to use the wish-making power of the combined Ladybug Miraculous and Cat Miraculous, and he doesn't want Hawk Moth to find out about him or the Miraculous jewelry box, making him cautious about taking out other Miraculouses besides the Ladybug and Cat Miraculouses.

In &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)|Catalyst]]&quot;, Master Fu feared that there would be a day that Hawk Moth would discover the unbound abilities of his powers.

In &quot;Backwarder&quot;, from Marianne Lenoir he is aware that Hawk Moth knows his identity.

{{HideSpoiler|During &quot;Ikari Gozen&quot;, he keeps a low profile now that Hawk Moth discovered his identity.}}

=== [[Lê Chiến Kim]] ===
He meets Kim at the Boys only party that Kim helped Nino plan for Adrien. As Kim's kind act of catching Fu when he lost his balance on top of the cool box he was standing on, as well as using it to keep the Miracle Box close by and safely hidden. He saw that Kim has the potential of becoming a Miraculous holder. When Ladybug and her team were captured by Party Crasher, Fu decides to trust what he saw in Kim before secretly giving him the Monkey Miraculous as he knew that its power and the right holder would be able to save the other young Miraculous holders and restore order with. But as Fu witnesses Kim and Xuppu &quot;bonding&quot; by making silly faces at each other he begins to wonder if he had made the right choice or not.

But after secretly watching him defeat Party Crasher and work well with the other heroes Wang decides that Kim may have been the right choice as he returns the Monkey Miraculous.

[[File:Is this Master Fu.jpg|thumb|First revealed image of Wang Fu from a Korean journal.]]
* In an old synopsis, Wang is described as the Guardian of the Orb, but [[Thomas Astruc]] denounced it as an older concept of him.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/657960926075854849&lt;/ref&gt;
* At a licensing show in Korea, the Ladybug and Cat Noir journals were available. An attendee took a picture of a mysterious figure watching Marinette and Adrien in the park from a journal. When asked who the figure was, [[Wilfried Pain]] replied that he is Master Fu.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/679026956374028293&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wang Fu is 186 years old, making him the oldest known human character in the series. 
** His longevity is not linked to his Miraculous, but to his lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousMX/status/940694063661178880&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wang Fu is the only known Miraculous holder to not have been seen transformed in both Season 1 and Season 2.
** In &quot;Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)&quot;, Fu attempts to transform, but his back gives out before he succeeds. 
* Currently, he is the only human to know the secret identities of both Ladybug and Cat Noir because he gave them their Miraculouses.
* Wang will make an appearance in &quot;The Chinese Legend&quot;, although his role in the special is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/MoonieBalloonie/status/756960058798280705&lt;/ref&gt;
* As of &quot;Sapotis&quot;, Hawk Moth is shown to be aware of Master Fu's existence as a Guardian in Paris.
** However, he is not aware that Mr. Chan (aka Wang Fu) is the guardian.
*** Until &quot;[[Backwarder]]&quot; when he learns Master Fu's name after akumatizing Marianne Lenoir, although Hawk Moth is unaware that Master Fu goes by the alias &quot;Mr. Chan&quot;.
{{HideSpoiler|&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
* Soon he figures out his identity in &quot;Ikari Gozen.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;}}
* In Chinese, Wang (王) means &quot;king&quot;, possibly originating from the similar character 汪, meaning vast (often describing oceans).&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_(surname)&lt;/ref&gt;
** Fu can be written as many characters in Chinese, but meanings include &quot;symbol&quot;, &quot;talisman&quot;, &quot;teacher&quot;, &quot;fortune&quot;, and &quot;good luck.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu_(surname)&lt;/ref&gt;
* As shown in the episode &quot;[[Syren]]&quot; Master Fu uses the false name Mr. Chan and it is used again in &quot;Backwarder&quot;.
* In &quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;, his nightmare is that ghosts of the Guardian of the Miraculous will accuse him of burning down the temple and losing the Peacock and Butterfly Miraculouses.
* During a Q &amp; A on January 15 2018, [[Jeremy Zag]] confirmed Master Fu will pass on the [[Miracle Box]] to another character, which is later revealed in &quot;[[Backwarder]]&quot; to be Marinette. &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousINTL/status/1085274428391542784&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Akumatized villains|The Scarlet Army]]}}'''The Battle of the Scarlet Army '''was a battle between [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] and his army of akumatized villains and the [[French Miraculous superhero team]]. The battle took place on the titular Heroes' Day.

In his campaign to obtain the [[Ladybug Miraculous|Ladybug]] and [[Cat Miraculous]], Gabriel Agreste and Nathalie formulated a plan to recall various previous akumatized victims to form an army known as the Scarlet Army battle Ladybug and Cat Noir.

== History ==
=== Background information ===
Previous to the battle, Hawk Moth had akumatized over two dozen Parisian civilians into villains, including [[Lila Rossi]]. With his assistant and accomplice, [[Nathalie Sancoeur]], the two planned one final assault with the intention of finally getting [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]] to surrender their [[Miraculouses]], or finally be able to take them by force.

=== Heroes' Day ===
==== Akumatizing Lila ====
The plan finally came to fruition on Heroes' Day, a public celebration of Paris' heroes. Knowing the parade would increase Lila's anger by tenfold, Gabriel, via news coverage, proclaimed Volpina, Lila's akumatized identity, a fraud and cheap knockoff. This proved enough to make Lila susceptible to [[Akumatization|akumatization]]. Gabriel, now Hawk Moth, charged a butterfly, creating an akuma, and sent it off to Lila who gladly became master of illusion, Volpina, once more.

==== Volpina's illusion ====
Once again empowered, Volpina created an illusion of an akumatized Ladybug fighting Cat Noir. The illusionary heroes' fight ends with Ladybug using Cat Noir's [[Cataclysm]] against him, taking his Miraculous and proclaiming victory for Hawk Moth. This leaves all of Paris in a state of mass sadness and disappointment and, as Hawk Mtoh puts it, this creates a &quot;chasm of despair and fear&quot; about to burst wide open.

==== Akumatizing Nathalie ====
Hawk Moth then purifies Volpina's akuma, de-akumatizing her. He then turns to Nathalie, asks her if she is certain of what they're about to do before akumatizing her into Catalyst, a power-boosting villain. Catalyst then empowers's Hawk Moth's [[cane]], turning him red and into Scarlet Moth. Now able to create as many akumas as he desires, Hawk Moth transforms a swarm of butterflies into scarlet-coloured akumas and commands them to find the Parisians despairing for Ladybug and Cat Noir.

==== Mass akumatization ====
Marinette and Adrien, upon returning to school, learn of their superhero alter egos apparent defeat via a news report by [[Nadja Chamack]] with [[Jagged Stone]] and [[Clara Nightingale]]. As the three despair, they notice the akumas and are reakumatized into Prime Queen, Guitar Villain and Frightningale, respectively. The three then announce the rise of Scarlet Moth.

The students of [[Collège Françoise Dupont]] watch before the akumas reach themselves. In fits of fear the students fruitlessly run for cover, resulting in [[Mylène Haprèle]], [[Ivan Bruel]], [[Max Kanté]] and [[Rose Lavillant]] reverting to their akumatized identities. [[Juleka Couffaine]] is then backed into a wall by a swarm of akumas but at Marinette's urging controls her fear enough to be passed over. The rest of the students follow suit and [[Alya Césaire]] informs her family to do the same.

Outside [[Adrien's bodyguard]] is caught by the akumas, once more becoming Gorizilla. Inside, [[Lê Chiến Kim|Dark Cupid]] flies over the quad as [[Fred Haprèle]] and [[Alix Kubdel]] become The Mime and Timebreaker again. Marinette and Adrien, herding students to safety run off to transform, Marinette successfully, intending to see [[Wang Fu]] for reinfocements, but Adrien is caught by Gorizilla, charged by Scarlet Moth with keeping Adrien safe.

The akumas, the Scarlet Army, then heads off to find Scarlet Moth.

==== Skirmish in the sewers ====
[[Sabrina Raincomprix|Vanisher]] is charged by Scarlet Moth to follow Ladybug, believing she will lead her to the Guardian. Seemingly sensing the villain's presence, Ladybug diverts into a sewer. She quickly dispatches of Vanisher, purifies her akuma and deakumatizes Sabrina. Sabrina rejoices at Ladybug's return as Ladybug realises Volpina was responsible for the illusion.

==== Adrien's escape ====
As Gorizilla walks Adrien to the [[Eiffel Tower]], Plagg flies behind the two and uses a weak Cataclysm to weaken the pavement causing the giant to stumble and free Adrien. Adrien quickly tranforms and sets off.

==== Building an army ====
===== Retrieving the Miraculous =====
Ladybug, now Marinette, turns up at Fu's shop, who says he feared Hawk Moth would realise the true potential of the [[Butterfly Miraculous]]. Pulling out the [[Miracle Box]], [[Tikki]] urges Marinette to take all the Miraculouse but says that &quot;less is more&quot; and she won't have time to explain the Miraculous. Requiring allies already in the know, she takes the [[Fox Miraculous|Fox]], [[Bee Miraculous|Bee]] and [[Turtle Miraculous]].

===== Recruiting Rena Rouge, Carapace and Queen Bee =====
Now Ladybug once more, she rendezvous with Cat Noir, tasking him with taking the Bee Miraculous to Chloe. She then heads off to Alya and [[Nino Lahiffe]], still hiding in the school. Before giving the two their Miraculous she apologises for revealing their identities to once another. The two greet their kwamis then transform into Rena Rouge and Carapace.

Chloe, who left the school to set up her Bee signal, waits for Ladybug to arrive. Cat Noir turns up and, after a few minutes of bickering, hands over the Bee Miraculous to Chloe. Pollen greets her holder and Chloe transforms into Queen Bee.

===== The Heroes' plan =====
The five heroes comes together a top a building near the Eiffel Tower and watch the villains. Shocked, they see Scarlet Moth announce himself and his army and, feeling Ladybug and Cat Noir's presence, offers Paris' Champions one last chance at surrender. At Cat Noir's asking for her plan, Ladybug despairs that while Scarlet Moth is prepared, they are not. Cat Noir notes that they've beaten everyone of the villains as a duo, and now they are five. The team then affirm their belief that they will be victorious and the battle begins.

=== The Battle ===
==== Initial victory ====
The team face off against Stormy Weather, Pharaoh, Riposte, The Mime, Roger Cop and Princess Fragrance. Carapace defends Ladybug from Stomry Weather as Queen Bee and Rena Rouge deakumatize Pharaoh and Princess Fragrance before saving Jalil and Rose. Together Cat Noir and Carapace dispatch of The Mime and Riposte. Drawing her fire, Ladybug distracts Stormy Weather long enough for Queen Bee to break her akuma and Cat Noir to save Aurore. Finally, Ladybug deakumatizes Roger Cop.

==== Assault on the Bourgeois ====
While the team fight, Scarlet Moth directs Dark Cupid to attack [[Audrey Bourgeois]], [[André Bourgeois]] and their butler [[Butler Jean|Jean]] making them susceptible to akumatization. The three become their akumatized identities once more with the intention of punishing Chloe before heading to the battle.

==== Reakumatizing the villains and the heroes ====
Ladybug summons her [[Lucky Charm]] and readies herself to use it. Dark Cupid, now returned to the battlefield, assaults Aurore, Jalil, Kagami, Fred, Roger and Rose who are then reakumatized by Scarlet Moth. The five once again face off against the villains, now aided by Dark Cupid. Scarlet Moth then unleashes a horde of akumas as the heroes struggle to fend off the attack.

As the heroes fight, Carapace loses his shield defending himself against Pharaoh and is targeted by Dark Cupid. Rena Rouge sees this, attempts to warn Carapace before throwing herself in front of the arrow to protect her love. Rena struggles to fight the negative emotions as Carapace restrains her and attempts to soothe her. Undefended, Queen Bee protects the two as she proclaims she'll never allow negative emotions to get the better of her just as Style Queen, Malediktator and Despair Bear arrive in a cloud of glitter.

Rena manages to judo flip Carapace and allows an akuma to infect her Miraculous becoming Rena Rage. Carapace despairs at this and an akuma infects his own Miraculous, becoming Shell Shock. Queen Bee struggles against her akumatized parents and does not see Despair Bear jump out from hiding. The Bear restrains her while Dark Cupid strikes her and an akuma infects her haircomb and she once more becomes Queen Wasp.

==== Escape into the sewers ====
Unable to use her Lucky Charm, which necessitated all the team to work, Ladybug tells Cat Noir to use Cataclysm on the ground underneath them. The pavement gives way and the two escape into the sewers. The two jump into separate sections of sewer to detransform and feed their kwamis and recharge. Marinette does not believe the two can win but Adrien asserts that the two, as a duo, always won.

Hawk Moth orders [[Otis Césaire|Animan]] to follow the two into the sewers and so by shapeshiting into a panther. The villains charge into the sewers after the heroes and the two jump off a giant ledge. Throwing their respective aquatic power ups into the air, their kwamis eat them and they transform with their aquatic suits. The two are confronted by [[Ondine|Syren]] and then by Animan, shapeshifted as a catfish. The two deakumatize and rescue the two, emerging in the [[Seine]].

Suddenly, the Seine begins to freeze over as [[Philippe|Frozer]], atop the Eiffel Tower, freezes a small section of Paris. Just as the surface is about to be frozen, Ladybug, Cat Noir, Ondine and Otis emerge and the heroes detransfrom from their aquatic suits to their regular ones. Ladybug quickly deakumatizes Frozer, as Ondine and Otis flee, before proclaiming herself, the ''real'' Ladybug, to be back. Ladybug then unleashes all the purified butterflies she'd captured. The butterflies fly across Paris and re-inspires hope in the Parisians.

==== The Parisians' barricade ====
As [[Armand D'Argencourt|Darkblade]] and his forces charge against Ladybug and Cat Noir, the two flee. The villains in the sewers emerge and also give chase. The two encounter a barricade of vehicles and [[Nora Césaire]] emerges, holding a French flag aloft. Leading her own army of Parisian civilians, including the Dupain-Chengs, Gina Dupain, Luka and Anarka Couffaine, Marc Anciel, Marlena Cesaire and even little Manon Chamack, she calls that they can &quot;be heroes just for one day&quot;. They hold off the villains for Ladybug and Chat Noir while Gina and Marlena encourage the heroes to &quot;go save the world&quot;. Civilians in houses along the street grab and restrain the akumatized heroes.

Scarlet Moth then commands the kaiju-sized villains to attack. Before they can, a civilian distracts [[August|Gigantitan]] with his car, Stoneheart is floored and restrained with construction vehicles, Horrificator is downed and Gorizila attacked with helicopters. As the two come upon the Eiffel Tower, Ladybug and Cat Noir manage to defeat Gamer and [[André Glacier|Glaciator]] with each other's attacks.

==== Confrontation with Scarlet Moth ====
Ladybug and Cat Noir confront Scarlet Moth before summoning their powers. As the three verbally spar, it's revealed that the Scarlet Moth they're speaking to is an illusionary copy created by Volpina who is hiding nearby. Dark Cupid also watches from the sky, an arrow notched and aimed at them. Ladybug attempts to encourage Scarlet Moth to fight alongside them on the side of good before seeing the ''real'' Scarlet Moth emerge behind her in the reflection of her Lucky Charm. Ladybug tackles Cat Noir away as the illusion disperses after being hit by Dark Cupid's arrow. Ladybug deakumatizes Dark Cupid and saves Kim.

Scarlet Moth fights Ladybug and Cat Noir and manage to destroy his cane, deakumatizing all the villains, sans Catalyst, and reverting him back to Hawk Moth. The three fight once again but this time Hawk Moth manages to best Ladybug and Cat Noir, both close to detransforming. Hawk Moth bears down upon the two when Carpace's shield knocks him back; Rena Rouge, Carapace and Queen Bee have arrived. Ladybug forms a prison using the Eiffel Tower and her yo-yo's string while Queen Bee summons her [[Venom]] and prepares to paralyse Hawk Moth.

==== Nathalie's choice and Hawk Moth's escape ====
Catalyst, seeing Hawk Moth's defeat, retrieves the [[Peacock Miraculous]] and becomes Mayura. She creates an [[amok]] and sends it to Hawk Moth, infecting his cane. She uses his despair to create a sentimonster in the form of a giant purple moth. The moth fends off the heroes and Hawk Moth escapes, detransforming. Ladybug summons [[Miraculous Ladybug (superpower)|Miraculous Ladybug]] and repairs the damage caused by the battle. As the heroes detransform Ladybug collects the borrowed Miraculous and returns them to Fu.

=== Aftermath ===
Gabriel rushes home and helps a weakened Nathalie, chastising her for using the Peacock Miraculous. Nathalie says she wishes to aid Gabriel until the end.

== Trivia ==
* Several previous akuma villains' powers play key parts in the battle:
** Volpina's power of illusion allows her to make the Parisians believe Ladybug and Cat Noir have lost and Hawk Moth has succeeded, spreading negativity throughout the city. Later she was able to create an illusion of Scarlet Moth to distract the heroes.
** Vanisher's invisibility allowed her to follow Ladybug unnoticed as she went to retrieve additional Miraculous, though ultimately this failed.
** Prime Queen's power to hijack TV broadcasts allowed Scarlet Moth to both publicly demand the Miraculous and also broadcast the battle and allow the Parisians to see their champion's &quot;failure&quot;.
** Dark Cupid's power to inflict negative emotions upon people with his arrows allows Scarlet Moth to reakumatize civilians quickly.
** Syren's ability to breathe underwater meant Scarlet Moth was able to keep her posted in the sewers should Ladybug and Cat Noir attempt to escape.
** Gorizilla was specifically reakumatized so as to maintain Adrien's safety while Hawk Moth wages his battle.

{{SpoilerButton}}
'''Gabriel Agreste''' is a famous fashion designer who created and owns the brand [[Gabriel (brand)|''Gabriel'']]. He is also the husband of [[Emilie Agreste]] and the father of [[Adrien Agreste]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://miraculeusecoccinelle.tumblr.com/post/129733355946/miraculous-les-aventures-de-ladybug-et-chat-noir&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Butterfly Miraculous]], when inhabited by [[Nooroo]], Gabriel transforms into '''Hawk Moth''' ('''Le Papillon''' in the French version, which translates to &quot;'''The Butterfly'''&quot;), who is the main antagonist of ''[[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]''. He wants [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Ladybug]] and [[Adrien Agreste|Cat Noir]]'s [[Miraculouses]] for himself in order to obtain absolute power and grant his secret wish. To achieve his goal, he creates and controls the [[akuma]]s, black and purple butterflies infected with evil who can [[Akumatization|transform normal people]] with negative emotions into [[Akumatized villains|supervillains]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animationmagazine.net/licensing/pgs-secures-deals-for-ladybug/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Miraculous.Ladybug/photos/a.296331537138512.58163.290735154364817/578155768956086/?type=1&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[The Collector]]&quot;, in order to avoid the suspicion of being Hawk Moth, he akumatizes himself into the '''Collector''', a supervillain who has the power to imprison any person or object within his magical notebook.

In &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)|Catalyst]]&quot;, which is part of the [[Heroes' Day]] special, he becomes '''Scarlet Moth''' with the enhancement given to him by [[Nathalie Sancoeur|the titular villain]].

In &quot;[[Mayura (Heroes' Day - Part 2)|Mayura]]&quot; he is amokised by [[Nathalie Sancoeur|Mayura]] and his emotions form a Moth-themed [[Amokization|sentimonster]] to help him escape the [[French Miraculous superhero team]].

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Gabriel is tall with combed-back light blond hair and blue eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
He wears black-framed silver glasses. He has a white dress shirt underneath a silver vest with red buttons and a cream-colored dress jacket, along with a red-and-white striped tie. He also wears red dress pants and white shoes with red laces. On the middle finger of his left hand, he has a silver band ring.

=== As Hawk Moth ===

Hawk Moth wears a dark purple dress shirt with a black butterfly-shaped lapel, the Butterfly Miraculous brooch on the center of the collar, and black dress pants. Over the majority of his face and neck, he wears a silver mask. Whenever he is controlling someone with an akuma, a bright purple butterfly-shaped outline appears on his face and around his eyes. He also has a dark indigo [[cane]] as the [[Miraculous tools|tool]] of his Miraculous.

=== As the Collector ===

The Collector's skin is pale purple. His hair sticks up in a point and is white with black vertical stripes, however, along with the back of his head and his neck is black. He wears a black dress suit with a white lapel, stiff shoulders, and black and red downward-bent stripes on the front. Each lower sleeve has a white stripe, and the Collector's hands have white gloves. Also, he wears black dress pants. His high heel boots are connected to his body suit, and they are black with black and white striped heels.

=== As Scarlet Moth ===
Scarlet Moth’s outfit is the same as Hawk Moth’s except it is colored burgundy-red due to the enhancement from [[Nathalie Sancoeur|Catalyst]]. His mask, [[cane]], and the Butterfly Miraculous are also colored the same red. His cane allows him to create more than one akuma, giving him an advantage.

== Personality ==
[[File:OR1-(457).png|left|thumb|Gabriel frustrated with Adrien and telling him he must be homeschooled.]]
Gabriel comes off as a cold, harsh, and very strict man. He is very protective of his son Adrien, having kept him home for most of his life, although having a distant relationship with him. Despite this, he can also be respectful and kind at times, especially when needing to act professionally. According to Adrien in &quot;[[Adrien's Double Life]]&quot;, ever since the disappearance of his wife, he is a changed man. He misses his wife greatly, and he sometimes has to be reminded not to forget that his son is also grieving. While he does seem to genuinely care for Adrien, this is often in a possessive way, with Gabriel not wanting anything bad to happen to him and making executive decisions about how to keep his son safe without considering how he may feel, such as in &quot;[[The Bubbler]]&quot;, when he unjustly deems [[Nino Lahiffe]] a bad influence for Adrien and forbids him from coming to his [[Agreste mansion|home]] ever again. He also strongly dislikes taking orders from anyone, even if they are from people who are trying to help and protect him, such as Ladybug and Cat Noir.

[[File:SW_Hawk_Moth_Miraculous.jpeg|thumb|Hawk Moth asking his akumatized villains to bring him Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses.]] 
As Hawk Moth, he is cold, cunning, and determined. His goal is to claim the Ladybug and Cat Miraculouses to gain their absolute power necessary to achieve his dearest secret wish, not caring if he causes people harm in the process. However, he can be merciful with those he cares about, such as in &quot;[[Gorizilla]]&quot;, when he orders the supervillain to drop Ladybug in order to save Adrien who is falling off the building. He is also aware of the equivalent exchange drawback of making a wish with the Miraculouses, every wish having a reaction to maintain balance in the universe, but it doesn't appear to bother him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/ladybugspain/status/937128922248110081 Thomas Astruc stated this at Mangafest 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; His akumatized villains are his most powerful known weapon, and he chooses his victims carefully and cleverly, usually people who are emotionally at their weakest, giving them ideas if they're struggling to think one up.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/872023906080755713&lt;/ref&gt; He is a skilled liar and manipulator, persuading people that he cares about their problems and giving them powers to help solve them when in reality, he does so because he wants them to retrieve the Miraculouses for him. If things aren't going his way, he easily loses his patience, threatening harm to Ladybug, Cat Noir, and even to the villains he creates. After a villain's defeat, Hawk Moth determinedly vows revenge and, while stopping for a while afterward, doesn't wait too long to try again with his akumas.

[[File:SB_(874).png|thumb|left|Gabriel declares that he will find where the kwamis are and take their Miraculouses.]] 
Gabriel is obsessed with finding a way to save his wife, but is willing to give up his evil ways to protect Adrien from being caught in the crossfire or being targeted by the villains he creates. Nonetheless, as shown in &quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;, when he tells [[Nooroo]] that he’s going to kidnap the kwami friends of the latter as a gift so he can have unlimited powers at his disposal, it’s evident that he has become power-hungry due to being Hawk Moth for a long time and has gotten addicted to yearning power to the extreme degree that he’ll grasp every opportunity to seize the power in order to have easier access on stealing the [[Ladybug Miraculous]] and [[Cat Miraculous]], therefore explaining why he decides to return his villain position in &quot;[[Queen Wasp (Queen's Battle - Part 2)|Queen Wasp]]&quot;.

[[File:SB_(648).png|thumb|Hawk Moth delighted when Ladybug is weakened.]] 
He also has a bit of a habit of celebrating too soon when the heroes get weaken by his many akumatized villains, thinking it will get him closer to the heroes’ Miraculouses, showing that he can be hasty and impatient, blinded by the prospect of victory.

Gabriel has good hindsight and suspicions about things. In “Sapotis”, after Rena Rouge’s appearance, he reveals that he had suspected that there are more Miraculouses in Paris and a guardian. In &quot;Syren&quot;, he reveals that he’d suspected that Miraculouses had hidden powers after seeing Ladybug and Cat Noir in their aqua forms.

{{HideSpoiler|He is also very stubborn as he refuses to listen to Nooroo about how he's using the Butterfly Miraculous, showing that he's not remorseful about all the damage and chaos he’s caused in Paris and also very desperate to save his wife.}}

As The Collector, being a voluntary akumatization, his personality does not change much. He is obsessed with collecting everything he likes to replace the [[Miraculous spellbook]] but is still determined to take Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses. He also knows that he must protect his secret identity, telling the heroes that he would give their Miraculouses to Hawk Moth.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
[[File:VP_(13).png|thumb|left|Gabriel at his atelier on the phone arguing with an employee.]]
[[File:CH (1019).png|thumb|212x212px|Gabriel plays the piano with Adrien.]] 
Gabriel is an expert at designing fashions for clothes, accessories, and jewelry. Additionally, owning the ''Gabriel'' brand, he is well-versed at running a business, including solving problems by phone concerning design issues and presenting himself professionally when around others. In &quot;[[Captain Hardrock]]&quot;, it is shown that he knows how to play the piano. In &quot;[[Animaestro]]&quot; it is revealed that he can speak Japanese. In &quot;[[Party Crasher]]&quot;, he is able to grow and harvest butterflies.

=== As Hawk Moth ===
[[File:Akumatization_(27).png|thumb|left|Hawk Moth creating an akuma.|217x217px]]
Despite the fact that he doesn't often fight directly, Hawk Moth is a capable sword fighter, being able to defend himself and destroy miniature missiles from his own lair's defense protocol with his swordstick. This is shown in &quot;[[Robostus]]&quot; when his akumatized villain turns on him telling Hawk Moth he will use the Miraculouses himself.

Even without being transformed, Hawk Moth's Miraculous allows him to feel emotions, whether positive or negative, like an empath, so he can precisely pinpoint the person's name and the reason why they have negative emotions. This is first shown in &quot;[[Sandboy]]&quot;. Furthermore, Hawk Moth can control many akumas to form a swarm that makes a large version of his head, which he can speak through which is shown in &quot;[[Stoneheart (Origins - Part 2)|Stoneheart]]&quot;.
[[File:OR-2 (555).png|thumb|220x220px|Hawk Moth uses his swarm of akumas to form a large version of his head which he can speak through them]]
[[File:Butterfly Brooch.png|left|thumb|218x218px|Gabriel's Miraculous alerts him of a negative emotion by shining and making a high pitched sound.]]
Hawk Moth's main superpower is Akumatization, corrupting butterflies with dark energy which transforms them into akumas and then sending them out to possess an object of a vulnerable person. He can also keep his butterflies in his cane if he needs to use an akuma in another location other than his lair. If they agree to serve him, he transforms them into supervillains by corrupting their personalities and granting them a wide variety of superpowers or special abilities. He can also telepathically communicate with his so-called &quot;winners&quot;. A pink butterfly-shaped outline appears in front of his and the villains' faces when he does so. However, Hawk Moth is only able to create one villain at a time over the course of an indeterminate amount of time, Hawk Moth needs to convince his victims to accept the powers that he grants, and the akumatized supervillains that he creates do still have a will of their own and can either disobey him or carry out his orders incompetently. However, if a supervillain doesn't go and retrieve the Miraculous like they were asked to, Hawk Moth can control their bodies for a brief amount of time in order to inflict pain onto them until they agree to do it as quickly as possible. 
[[File:Light mask.png|left|thumb]]
When an akuma isn't purified by Ladybug, it will multiply and turn other people into frozen copies of the original akumatized villain. Hawk Moth can recall and trap the original akuma in the top of his cane in order to release it again when the victim gets sad or angry once more. This turns the victim into the same akumatized villain, but it also unfreezes the copies of them, which the original villain can command and control. However, once the original akuma is de-evilized, its copies vanish, reverting the duplicates of the villain back to normal. He is also capable of purifying an akuma himself as shown in &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)|Catalyst]]&quot;.

=== As The Collector ===
[[File:Screenshot 2019-02-21 09.04.26.png|thumb|187x187px|The Collector using his notebook to defend himself from the CD's.]]
When Gabriel akumatizes himself he becomes The Collector. The Collector is able to trap objects and people in the form of drawings inside his notebook. He throws the notebook like a boomerang, and while the notebook can go very far distances, once it captures something or someone by hitting them, it returns to him wherever he is. This is intensified as he can summon it. He can also utilize the notebook as a shield against projectiles, opening the book, either holding it sturdily or waving it around, so it traps the object being thrown towards him.

[[File:The Collector agile fight.png|thumb|left|220x220px|The Collector uses his agility and notebook to fight.]]
Anything it passes through is trapped no matter how big it is. However, there is a limit to how much can be absorbed, as shown when Ladybug used a makeshift conveyor belt to launch a barrage of Adrien's CDs at him and he used his book to absorb them. When he then tried to absorb Ladybug, he found that the book's pages were all full and could not absorb anything more. Additionally, The Collector is quick and agile, easily flipping, jumping, and dodging attacks. 

=== As Scarlet Moth ===
[[File:Enhanced Cane.png|thumb|Catalyst enhances Hawk Moth's cane to allow him to transform.]]
Scarlet Moth has the same abilities as Hawk Moth, but he is stronger as he can create as many [[akumatized villains]] as he desires. This is caused by his cane getting affected by Catalyst's enhancement. Instead of creating normal [[akuma]]s, he creates scarlet akumas, which are dark crimson red. Also, when someone gets [[Akumatization|akumatized]], they get a scarlet red theme like him. Scarlet Moth can also use his cane to summon more scarlet akumas to make the heroes feel intimidated and outnumbered.

[[File:Scarlet Akuma release.png|thumb|left|202x202px|Scarlet Moth releases scarlet akumas with his cane.]]
Unlike with normal akumatized villains, Scarlet Moth can akumatize his victims without having to ask for their permission and the created villains are bound to obey him, showing that the will that they still had in a normal akumatization is now diminished. He used [[Lê Chiến Kim|Dark Cupid]] to create the negative emotions he needed so he could akumatize his villains.

== Trivia ==
* Gabriel is named after [[Wikipedia:Coco Chanel|Gabrielle &quot;Coco&quot; Chanel]], who created the French designer brand, [[Wikipedia:Chanel|''Chanel'']].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/708782595270692864&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gabriel is [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]]'s role model as she hopes to be a great fashion designer just like him.
* Gabriel admires Marinette's talent, as shown in &quot;[[Queen Wasp (Queen's Battle - Part 2)|Queen Wasp]]&quot;.
* Gabriel's phone number as listed in Adrien's phone contacts is +33678424.
* In &quot;The Evillustrator&quot;, [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé]] bribes [[Sabrina Raincomprix|Sabrina]] by using a beret that Gabriel designed.
[[File:VP (22).png|thumb|Gabriel putting the Miraculous book in his safe.]]
* Gabriel has a secret safe behind the [[painting of Emilie Agreste]] in his atelier. It contains the [[Peacock Miraculous]], a picture of [[Emilie Agreste]], tickets for Tibet, and a book about the [[Miraculouses]].
** In &quot;Volpina&quot;, Adrien takes the Miraculous book, unbeknownst to Gabriel, and the book eventually ends up in Marinette's hands. Once he discovers that it’s missing in &quot;The Collector&quot;, he, despite having the book's pages saved digitally, becomes very angry and punishes Adrien, most likely due to the book making him the primary suspect for being Hawk Moth.
** The painting of Emilie Agreste also conceals another secret — access to the entrance to Hawk Moth's lair. The passage opens when certain spots of the painting are pressed. This has been shown in the Season 2 episodes &quot;The Collector&quot; and &quot;Gorizilla&quot;.
* Hawk Moth is also called &quot;Butterfly&quot; in other early sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
** In the Castilian Spanish version, Hawk Moth's name is ''Lepidóptero'', which comes from the scientific order called ''[[Wikipedia:Lepidoptera|Lepidoptera]]'', which contains all butterflies and moths.
[[File:PV LQ (193).png|thumb|Hawk Moth's appearance in the Ladybug PV.]]
* Hawk Moth's appearance is very different from his appearance in the Ladybug PV. In the PV, he doesn't wear a mask, has white hair and silver eyes, and wears a white dress suit with a pale tan vest and bow.
* After sending an akuma, he rotates his staff with his left hand, which possibly indicates he's left-handed.
* Both the butterfly and the moth symbolize change or personal evolution. This is likely in connection with his ability to corrupt and transform others into his henchmen.
* The design of Hawk Moth's mask is a reference to the supervillain Fantômas from the 1964 [[Wikipedia:Fantômas (1964 film)|French film with the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/666886417239449600&lt;/ref&gt;
* As revealed in &quot;The Dark Owl&quot;, Hawk Moth's intentions for getting Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses is to change a past event. 
** In &quot;[[Zombizou]]&quot; he mentions that his cherished wish is linked to love.
** In &quot;Queen Wasp&quot; and &quot;Catalyst&quot;, it is hinted that Gabriel's intentions for getting the Ladybug and Cat Miraculouses are linked to a promise with Emilie.
* Hawk Moth usually reveals his name to his victims when he corrupts them. However, he never gave out his name to the Evillustrator or [[Armand D'Argencourt|Darkblade]].
* As seen in episodes like &quot;Darkblade&quot;, &quot;Antibug&quot;, and &quot;Princess Fragrance&quot;, Hawk Moth has the time and ability to akumatize more than one person a day, even though it is not more than one person each time.
** In &quot;Timebreaker&quot;, however, he is able to twice akumatize Alix for the two of them to operate concurrently, by virtue of the timeline of events being altered by her time-traveling ability.
** In &quot;Sapotis&quot;, he was able to akumatize both of Alya's sisters because they were both holding onto the same object. 
[[File:Akuma_removal_motion.png|thumb|Hawk Moth removes Volpina's akuma in “Catalyst”|178x178px]]
* He can take away the power of his akumatized villains and cause them pain, which gives him leverage, though the ability was originally meant to be a fail-safe if the akumatized hero's power was used wrongly or for evil &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/872020337164251139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/872021350373896196&lt;/ref&gt;.
** This power to remove a villain’s akuma is first seen in use in the episode &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)|Catalyst]]&quot;.
* He sometimes uses puns, such as telling the akuma in &quot;The Evillustrator&quot; to &quot;draw [Nathaniel] into our evil web.&quot;
* Before &quot;The Collector&quot; other clues suggesting that Gabriel was Hawk Moth are:
** In &quot;The Bubbler&quot; it was not actually confirmed that Gabriel had been kidnapped by the bubbles of the titular villain.
** Gabriel and Hawk Moth have the same voice actors in many dubs.
** In &quot;[[Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)|Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]&quot; the silhouette of the civilian form of Hawk Moth is very similar to that of Gabriel, and they seem to have the same clothes, besides having a picture of Emilie.
** In &quot;Simon Says&quot; Hawk Moth states that &quot;it's risky&quot; when he hears Simon Says say he will take Gabriel Agreste.
*** As soon as Gabriel is left alone, Hawk Moth appears and is seen to walk ahead, and still in the same scene, he still seemed worried about what Simon Says was doing.
*** When Gabriel is hypnotized, Simon Says tells him that he is a butterfly.
*** Gabriel proves to be attracted to Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses.
* Gabriel is one of the tallest characters in the series.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/731025406552379392&lt;/ref&gt;
** Strangely, Hawk Moth is depicted taller than Gabriel, while in reality they are the same height.
* In some dubs, Gabriel and Hawk Moth have different voice actors. Examples are the Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, Hebrew, and Hungarian (only Season 1) dubs.&lt;ref&gt;http://dublanet.com.br/forum1/showthread.php?28044-Miraculous-As-Aventuras-de-Ladybug-(Miraculous-Tales-of-Ladybug-amp-Cat-Noir)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:w:c:pl.miraculousladybug:Gabriel Agreste|Gabriel's]] page in the Polish wiki.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Miraculous-Tales-of-Ladybug-and-Cat-Noir/ Comparing each characters individual profiles.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gyerek-vilag.tk/2015/12/miraculous-katicabogar-es-fekete-macska-kalandjai-a-szinkronhangok.html&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:OR1-(15).png|thumb|Emilie Agreste's image in the Butterfly Miraculous.]]
* In &quot;Volpina&quot;, Adrien confuses a [[Ancient Chinese Butterfly Miraculous holder|previous owner]] of the Butterfly Miraculous for Hawk Moth upon seeing his picture in the Miraculous Spellbook.
* [[Wilfried Pain]] has confirmed that Hawk Moth also has an origin story.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/WinnyGZ/status/776887360667672578&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Thomas Astruc]] additionally claimed that [[Season 2]] would explain how Hawk Moth found the Butterfly Miraculous&lt;ref&gt;Report on Thomas Astruc at Japan Weekened: https://twitter.com/Ladybug_Cartoon/status/780063589432451072&lt;/ref&gt; (although this information was ultimately not revealed in Season 2).
** Astruc also intends for Season 3 to reveal why Hawk Moth needs the Miraculouses.
* According to the Miraculous Ladybug San Diego Comic-Con 2016 panel and Los Angeles Comic Con 2016 panel, Hawk Moth will team up with another recurring villain in [[Season 3]], doubling him as a threat.&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/vtO8bbvmU0g?t=1561&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/IsTygn5xxZs?t=396&lt;/ref&gt;
** Also, in the former panel, it was revealed that Hawk Moth might be scared of someone for once.
* [[File:Screenshot 2019-02-02 17.54.27.png|thumb|220x220px|Scarlet Moth announces to all of Paris]] The episode &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)|Catalyst]]&quot; marks the first time Hawk Moth appears outside of his lair, and the next episode, &quot;[[Mayura (Heroes' Day - Part 2)|Mayura]]&quot; marks the first time he directly fights Ladybug and Cat Noir. &quot;Mayura&quot; also confirms that Hawk Moth can stay transformed even after using [[Akumatization|his power]].
* On July 26, 2018, the official Miraculous Ladybug YouTube Channel uploaded a Global Promo showing (among other things) the 3D modeling of the episode set in the [[Musée Grévin|Grévin museum]].&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/FWhXhZKog6Q?t=59&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel's character model appears briefly on the second flight of stairs.
*Hawk Moth's power is similar to [[w:c:ben10:Whampire|Whampire]]. However, Whampire's Corrupturas were used to make evil armies by his species and used by Whampire to make allies, Hawk Moth's Akumas were meant to make superheroes and used to make supervillians.

'''Nathalie Sancoeur'''&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Thomas_Astruc/status/655411981617381376&lt;/ref&gt; is the secondary antagonist of [[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]] and [[Gabriel Agreste]]'s assistant who manages his work, [[Agreste mansion|mansion]] and takes care of his son [[Adrien]].

In &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)|Catalyst]]&quot;, which is part of the &quot;[[Heroes' Day]]&quot; special, she is [[Akumatization|akumatized]] by [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] into '''Catalyst''', a power-enhancing supervillain. 

In &quot;[[Mayura (Heroes' Day - Part 2)|Mayura]]&quot;, in order to help [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]] escape from the [[French Miraculous superhero team]], Nathalie uses the [[Peacock Miraculous]] and, as the Miraculous is inhabited by [[Duusu]], she becomes '''Mayura''', a peacock-themed supervillain who helps Hawk Moth by creating [[Amokization#Amokized sentimonsters|allies]] for akumatized villains. She is said to appear as [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]]'s &quot;boss&quot; in [[Season 3]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/stelllalights/status/784490783810416640&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/IsTygn5xxZs?t=396&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

== Appearance ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Nathalie stands at an average adult height with black hair that is pulled back into a bun with the hair on the left side of her head that is dyed a dark pink or red color, a piece of hair hanging over her face and dull blue eyes.

=== Civilian attire ===
Nathalie has glasses with black and red striped frames and she wears periwinkle eye shadow. She wears a red turtleneck sweater, a black dress jacket, black pants and black medium-heel shoes. She also has round creamy-white earrings.

=== As Mayura ===
Mayura's eyes have pink irises and scleras that are pink which fade into dark indigo, and there is black liner around her eyes, resembling glasses. Her skin is a light indigo and her hair is dark blue, and part of it curls up underneath her left eye. She wears a peacock-feather-like cocktail hat, which is blue and tear-shaped with a light pink mark in the center and a light blue, translucent veil over her right eye. She wears a blue dress with a fuzzy black collar and sleeves that end in a point on the back of her hand. The dress appears to have a set hexagonal texture, as well as a Peacock Miraculous in the center. The bottom of the dress has a front-slit skirt, and the end of the skirt has rounded points with dark blue, light-pink-centered spots, resembling a peacock's tail feathers. The rounded points are edged with translucent light blue material. Underneath the dress, she has translucent indigo tights that are opaque from the knees down, making the opaque section resemble high-heeled boots. She holds a blue [[hand fan]], which is similar in design to the end of her skirt, and a peacock-feather-like object in her other hand.

=== As Catalyst ===
Catalyst has periwinkle skin. Over her head, while leaving her mouth exposed, she wears a black helmet with a red visor with black edges and a red spike pointing towards the back of her head. Catalyst also wears a black dress suit with stiff shoulders, including a dark red front and swan neck collar that features a red downward-arrow-shaped section in the center. The sleeves cover her entire arms, with the tips of her fingers fading into red. Also, Catalyst has pocket-like ridges on each side of her hips, and her pant legs come down to her feet, having red high-heels, soles, and tips.

== Personality ==
[[File:OR-2 (149).png|thumb|left|Nathalie reluctantly allows Adrien to enter the school.]]
Nathalie is a serious and formal woman who works very diligently as [[Gabriel Agreste]]'s assistant. She has a cold and distant demeanor as she doesn't openly show her emotions around others most of the time. Smart and sensible, Nathalie is able to reason with Gabriel and Adrien whenever they are acting inconsiderately or emotionally, sometimes in relation to each other. While not warm, she can be cordial and polite. However, in situations where she is dealing with Gabriel, she becomes nervous, being afraid to disappoint him. Her desire to be on his good side leads her to unfair actions, such as giving Adrien a [[Adrien's scarf|birthday gift]] and claiming it is from Gabriel when it is actually from [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette]] in &quot;[[The Bubbler]]&quot;. She cares for Adrien, although she doesn't usually openly show it, as she requests to Gabriel that his son go to school on his behalf while she would handle his schedule, and she desires what is best for the Agreste family.

[[File:Catalyst (98).png|thumb|Nathalie goes along with Gabriel's plan.]] 
However, her concern is limited to the Agreste family only, and she doesn't seem to care about the other Parisians' well-being. In fact, she obeys Gabriel's orders with fierce loyalty no matter how morally wrong they are and even helps him with his plans, which is seen in &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)|Catalyst]]&quot; and &quot;[[Mayura (Heroes' Day - Part 2)|Mayura]]&quot; as she takes sadistic joy in fooling the heroes into thinking they can win all the while. Even though Nathalie has a cool and calm demeanor, she can lose her temper on occasion and would disregard any detrimental consequences as a result, as seen in &quot;Mayura&quot;, when she was frustrated by the fact that her boss was failing, and even went as far as letting herself be harmed by the power of the damaged [[Peacock Miraculous]] in her transformation.

== Abilities ==
=== As a civilian ===
Nathalie is an effective and objective assistant, being able to take care of Gabriel's needs and organize Adrien's schedule.

=== As Mayura ===
[[File:MA (512).png|thumb|left|A protector summoned by Mayura, a giant purple hawk moth, confronting the team of heroes.]]
Mayura has enhanced physical characteristics: speed, strength, and agility. She showed considerable hand-to-hand combat skills and stealth against an injured Cat Noir and Queen Bee.

Mayura shares similar abilities with Hawk Moth as she is able to infuse a feather plucked from her hand fan with her power, transforming it into an [[Amok]], and send it out to possess an object owned by a chosen target, with whom she can communicate telepathically. This action will then give an emotion from her target a physical form of that person's choosing, to act as the target's ally until recalled via a snap of her fingers, which destroys it. While Mayura is communicating, a blue curved peacock mask appears in front of her and her target's faces.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/MiraculousINTL/status/1011622625066586113&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== As Catalyst ===
[[File:Catalyst (490).png|thumb|180px|Catalyst infusing Hawk Moth's cane, turning him into the powerful Scarlet Moth.]]
Catalyst has the power to multiply/enhance/increase someone's powers; she does this by infusing scarlet energy into an object belonging to her target, similar to an [[list of akumatized objects|akumatized object]]. When affected, the person gains a red-colored outfit. In [[Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]]'s case, with this power enhancement, he became Scarlet Moth, allowing him to [[Akumatization|akumatize]] multiple butterflies and transform multiple people at once. She can also communicate with the person she enhanced, during which a red sharp-edged butterfly mask appears in front of both of their faces, similar to Hawk Moth.

== Relationships ==
=== [[Gabriel Agreste|Gabriel Agreste/Hawk Moth]] ===
[[File:TB Distressed Nathalie 2.jpeg|thumb|left|Nathalie distressed by Gabriel's phone call.]]
Nathalie works professionally as Gabriel's assistant. She makes sure to take care of all of his requests and looks after his son, Adrien. Occasionally, she tends to get nervous when dealing with him, such as when she forgot to buy a gift for Adrien on his behalf, leading her to lie and tell Adrien that Marinette's gift was actually from his father. Although wary of him becoming disappointed with her, she is willing to stand up to him for Adrien's sake, as when she voiced her displeasure with him for being too distracted by his missing [[Emilie Agreste|wife]] to see his own son's misery during &quot;[[Santa Claws]]&quot;.

[[File:TC (756).png|thumb|Nathalie watches as Gabriel enters his lair.]] 
In &quot;[[The Collector]]&quot;, it is revealed that Nathalie is aware that Gabriel is Hawk Moth. Furthermore, &quot;[[Queen Wasp (Queen's Battle - Part 2)|Queen Wasp]]&quot; indicates that she has deep feelings for Gabriel, being relieved when he decides to stop being Hawk Moth but devastated when he changes his mind because he loves Emilie too much. Her loyalty is so strong that in &quot;[[Catalyst (Heroes' Day - Part 1)|Catalyst]]&quot;, she helps with his plan for taking Ladybug's and Cat Noir’s Miraculouses by allowing him to akumatize her, and in &quot;[[Mayura (Heroes' Day - Part 2)|Mayura]]&quot;, she even risks herself by using the damaged Peacock Miraculous to transform into the titular villain in order to help Gabriel after he, as Hawk Moth, gets de-transformed back into his normal villain form.

{{HideSpoiler|According to her in &quot;[[Stormy Weather 2]]&quot;, she admits having deep admiration for Gabriel and knows that it has presumably morphed into romantic feelings.}}

=== [[Adrien Agreste|Adrien Agreste/Cat Noir]] ===
[[File:TB (48).png|thumb|left|Nathalie gives Adrien his schedule.]]
Nathalie is usually serious around Adrien, not being very warm or close to him. Despite this, she does care for him, which she shows when she requests to Gabriel that Adrien be allowed to go to school after seeing how much he wanted to attend. She also shows that she cares for Adrien in &quot;Santa Claws&quot; when she sees how sad he is about his father not celebrating Christmas, and asks Gabriel to spend time with his son. She even softly smiles at Adrien's joy at his friends being allowed into the mansion on Christmas.

{{HideSpoiler|In &quot;[[Stormy Weather 2]]&quot;, Nathalie claims to also have developed a great sense of affection for Adrien as she watched him grow up.}}

Nathalie is unaware that Adrien is Cat Noir. However, she despises the hero and wants to help Gabriel take his Miraculous from him, even telling Hawk Moth that she'll go to any lengths to end his reign.

=== [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng|Marinette Dupain-Cheng/Ladybug]] ===
[[File:SS_(914).png|thumb|Ladybug and Nathalie entering Adrien's room.]]
Nathalie has seldom encountered Marinette personally, only seeing her in person during the derby hat competition in &quot;[[Mr. Pigeon]]&quot; and briefly interacting with her in &quot;[[Style Queen (Queen's Battle - Part 1)|Style Queen]]&quot;. However, on Adrien's birthday in &quot;[[The Bubbler]]&quot;, she treats Marinette formally when on a speaker and disregards her by claiming to Adrien that Marinette's gift was from Gabriel.

Nathalie is unaware that Marinette is Ladybug. However, she despises the hero and wishes to help Gabriel take her Miraculous, even telling Hawk Moth that she'll go to any lengths to end her reign.

=== [[Chloé Bourgeois|Chloé Bourgeois/Queen Bee]] ===
Like most Parisian citizens, Nathalie is aware that Chloé is Queen Bee. Though she does express a little bit of doubt about it, Nathalie willingly helps Gabriel in his plot to bring Chloé over to his side. As Mayura, while battling her, she tries to persuade Chloé into joining her and Hawk Moth by saying that if she does, she can be Queen Bee whenever she likes, though Chloé refuses.
{{SpoilerButton}}
{{HideSpoiler|
===[[Duusu]]===
Nathalie uses her to transform into Mayura. While their relationship hasn't been much explored, it is clear that Duusu cares for Nathalie, as she gets upset when Nathalie collapses after using the [[Peacock Miraculous]] in &quot;[[Reflekdoll]]&quot;.}}

undef=}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;Tool for family trees.

==The Basics==
In the familytree sections, you put &quot;boxes&quot; separated with pipes, and they translate to symbols. The basics:

&lt;pre&gt;{{familytree/start|sample tree}}
{{familytree|MK|y|UN|}}
{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| |}}
{{familytree|JK| |AK|}}
{{familytree/end}}&lt;/pre&gt;

This gives:
{{familytree/start|sample tree}}
{{familytree|MK|y|UN|}}
{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| |}}
{{familytree|JK| |AK|}}
{{familytree/end}}

Next, add cat names to the boxes like this:
&lt;pre&gt;{{familytree/start|sample tree}}
{{familytree|MK|y|UN|MK=[[Mr. Kubdel]]|UN=Unknown}}
{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| |}}
{{familytree|JK| |AK|JK=[[Jalil Kubdel]]|AK=[[Alix Kubdel]]}}
{{familytree/end}}&lt;/pre&gt;

Giving:
{{familytree/start|sample tree}}
{{familytree|MK|y|UN|MK=[[Mr. Kubdel]]|UN=Unknown}}
{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| |}}
{{familytree|JK| |AK|JK=[[Jalil Kubdel]]|AK=[[Alix Kubdel]]}}
{{familytree/end}}

And you can color the boxes:
&lt;pre&gt;{{familytree/start|sample tree}}
{{familytree|MK|y|UN|MK=[[Mr. Kubdel]]|UN=Unknown
|boxstyle_MK=background-color: #D3EBFD;
|boxstyle_UN=background-color: #FFDAE0;}}
{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| |}}
{{familytree|JK| |AK|JK=[[Jalil Kubdel]]|AK=[[Alix Kubdel]]
|boxstyle_JK=background-color: #D3EBFD;
|boxstyle_AK=background-color: #FFDAE0;}}
{{familytree/end}}&lt;/pre&gt;

Giving:
{{familytree/start|sample tree}}
{{familytree|MK|y|UN|MK=[[Mr. Kubdel]]|UN=Unknown
|boxstyle_MK=background-color: #D3EBFD;
|boxstyle_UN=background-color: #FFDAE0;}}
{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| |}}
{{familytree|JK| |AK|JK=[[Jalil Kubdel]]|AK=[[Alix Kubdel]]
|boxstyle_JK=background-color: #D3EBFD;
|boxstyle_AK=background-color: #FFDAE0;}}
{{familytree/end}}

&lt;noinclude&gt;Once we learn the names of new Kwamis enter their name in the Name field, this will probably break the image temporarily, but if you redirect File:List*KwamiName*.png to File:List*Miraculous*Kwami.png it should fix that, or leave it for someone else.

* Emilie Agreste mysteriously disappeared before the events of [[Season 1]]. In &quot;[[Style Queen (Queen's Battle - Part 1)|Style Queen]]&quot; and &quot;[[Queen Wasp (Queen's Battle - Part 2)|Queen Wasp]]&quot;, it was revealed that she is underneath the Agreste Mansion in the same room seen in &quot;[[Gorizilla]]&quot;, inside something resembling a coffin, in what appears to be in a comatose state.

** Later, the writers revealed at an event that Nino has a younger relative named [[Chris Lahiffe|Chris]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://youtu.be/tBGO07cb0Aw?t=1508 New info] released at an event at ZAG Studios on May 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
